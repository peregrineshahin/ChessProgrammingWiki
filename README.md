[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b18fd7e1-481c-40a1-a662-5f36558e4179/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/chessprogrammingwiki/deploys?=branch=main)

Welcome to the Chess Programming Wiki repository! This repository serves as a revival and continuation of the original Chess Programming Wiki (CPW), which was founded by Mark Lefler on October 26, 2007, and was first hosted on Wikispaces. Unfortunately, due to the inactiveness of that site, the need for such a website became neccessary.
## About
The Chess Programming Wiki is a comprehensive resource dedicated to the programming of computers for playing chess. Our goal is to provide a reference for every aspect of chess programming, covering information about programmers, researchers, chess engines, and various implementation techniques such as Late Move Reductions (LMR) and bitboards.

For didactic purposes, the CPW-Engine has been developed by some wiki members, and you can explore different ways to implement LMR and bitboard techniques, including discussions about the best magics for the most dense magic bitboard tables.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply navigate through the content using the left-hand navigation bar. All content is arranged hierarchically, allowing you to explore each page by following the provided links. If you're looking for something specific, you can use the search box at the top.
