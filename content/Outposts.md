## Occupying Holes


Some programmers apply a more common meaning of the word outpost, using this term in regard to a [strong square](Holes "Holes") in the center or opponent half of the board, defended by own pawn and no longer attackable by the opponent's pawn, occupied or about to be occupied by a knight. In this case the half-open file and provocation aspect of the outpost is lost, though the evaluation term is still useful.



## Factors influencing score


To give an estimate of a typical outpost score, [Toga log user manual](Toga_Log#UserManual "Toga Log") advocates a bonus for a knight outpost on a central square as 10 centipawns, but it is possible to see bonuses as large as 16 centipawns. Furthermore, outpost value can be increased if it is defended by two pawns (thus making exchange sacrifice much less profitable) or if opponent has no minors that he can exchange for an outpost piece.
