 [](File:NICBase.JPG) NICBase 3.0 Game Screen <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> 
**NICBase**, (NiCBase)  

a chess database program of the Dutch chess publishing company [New In Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_In_Chess) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, developed in the late 80s and early 90s by [Elsevier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier) <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> with [Hans](Hans_Kuijf "Hans Kuijf") and [Nico Kuijf](index.php?title=Nico_Kuijf&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nico Kuijf (page does not exist)") as affiliated developers. Originally designed for the [Atari ST](Atari_ST "Atari ST") <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>, NICBase was soon ported to the [IBM PC](IBM_PC "IBM PC") running under [DOS](MS-DOS "MS-DOS") supporting [CGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter), [Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_Graphics_Card) and [EGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Graphics_Adapter) cards, already a [GUI](GUI "GUI") with [mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse) or [keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard) controlled interaction with a [menu-bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_(computing)) and pull-down menus. The NICBase 3.0 format was not compatible to earlier database versions, which required conversion <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>. After the NICBase development was stopped in early 1993, the Kuijf brothers agreed with [TASC](TASC "TASC") president [Wil Sparreboom](Wil_Sparreboom "Wil Sparreboom") to make an entirely new database program [TascBase](TascBase "TascBase") instead <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>. NICBase was also supported by [Rebel 6.0](Rebel "Rebel"). 


There were attempts to develop a new NICBase front-end by [Peter van Diepen](Peter_van_Diepen "Peter van Diepen") and [Anton Schermer](index.php?title=Anton_Schermer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Anton Schermer (page does not exist)") <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a>, which was apparently not released to the public. While its back-end is still used by the *New In Chess* team to classify openings with the [NIC-Key](NIC-Key "NIC-Key"), NICBase is available as online database via the *New In Chess* site <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a>.
