[ Ostrich <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
**Ostrich** (The Ostrich),  

a chess program originally developed by [George Arnold](George_Arnold "George Arnold") and [Monroe Newborn](Monroe_Newborn "Monroe Newborn") at [Columbia University](Columbia_University "Columbia University") in 1971, and subsequently by Newborn at [McGill University](McGill_University "McGill University") since 1975 <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. Ostrich was the first chess program to compete on a [parallel system](Parallel_Search "Parallel Search") ([ACM 1982](ACM_1982 "ACM 1982")). It used eight [Data General](Nova "Nova") computers with each screen displaying the parallel computations taking place <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> . 



## Tournament Play


Ostrich had its debut at [ACM 1972](ACM_1972 "ACM 1972") with its best result of a second place finisher. It played the first five [World Computer Chess Championships](World_Computer_Chess_Championship "World Computer Chess Championship"), the [WCCC 1974](WCCC_1974 "WCCC 1974") in [Stockholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm), the [WCCC 1977](WCCC_1977 "WCCC 1977") in [Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto), the [WCCC 1980](WCCC_1980 "WCCC 1980") in [Linz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linz), the [WCCC 1983](WCCC_1983 "WCCC 1983") in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City), and the [WCCC 1986](WCCC_1986 "WCCC 1986") in [Cologne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne), and **15** [ACM North American Computer Chess Championships](ACM_North_American_Computer_Chess_Championship "ACM North American Computer Chess Championship") until [ACM 1987](ACM_1987 "ACM 1987"), including the [ACM 1983](ACM_1983 "ACM 1983") which was simultaneously the Fourth WCCC.

Quote from *Oral History of Monty Newborn* <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a> :




```C++ Monty: Maybe [David](David_Levy "David Levy") helped [Ben](Ben_Mittman "Ben Mittman") on the [second one](ACM_1971 "ACM 1971"). The second one was held in Chicago, where the Northwestern team lived. Ben had it in his own backyard, so to speak. The second tournament then was a big success, and the [third tournament](ACM_1972 "ACM 1972") I was back involved in organizing as well. For a number of years, [Mittman](Ben_Mittman "Ben Mittman") and I organized these tournaments together. I started competing myself in the Boston tournament, the third tournament.

```


```C++Q: With Ostrich?  
Monty: With Ostrich. Ostrich was not a bad program. It never quite reached the top, but it was not bad. Ben and I organized tournaments year after year. David Levy got involved with some. We organized the ACM tournaments yearly, and in addition we organized world championships every third year. This went on pretty consistently right up until the time that Kasparov played the computer. They’re still having these tournaments, but my interest as a scientist sort of was fulfilled when Kasparov lost to the computer. As a scientist, I would say that that was the end of the experiment. 

```





### WCCC 1974


Quote from *Canadian Chess* <a id="cite-note-9" href="#cite-ref-9">[9]</a> <a id="cite-note-10" href="#cite-ref-10">[10]</a>:




```C++A win in the following last round game would have given Ostrich a tie for first place in the [1st World Computer Championship](WCCC_1974 "WCCC 1974"). Unfortunately, the program missed the winning move, 35. Rxh6+, as finding it required a search depth of 19-ply, which was beyond its capabilities. It also missed another winning move, 39. Bf5, which required an 11-ply search.

### ACM 1982


 [](http://www.computerhistory.org/chess/full_record.php?iid=stl-431f4cc19ea63) 
[ACM 1982](ACM_1982 "ACM 1982"), Parallel Computer Chess Machine Ostrich <a id="cite-note-12" href="#cite-ref-12">[12]</a>




```C++Ostrich, developed by Monty Newborn, was the first chess program to compete on a parallel system. It used eight Data General computers with each screen displaying the parallel computations taking place. Through the 1970s and 1980s, Ostrich competed in five world championships, coming close to winning in 1974. 

```

## Description 1975


Ostrich ran on a [Data General SuperNOVA](Nova#SuperNOVA "Nova") computer, and was written in [Supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General_Nova#Assembly_language_examples) [assembly language](Assembly "Assembly") <a id="cite-note-13" href="#cite-ref-13">[13]</a> <a id="cite-note-14" href="#cite-ref-14">[14]</a>.



### Data Structures


Ostrich had a plane [8x8 board](8x8_Board "8x8 Board") with positive and negative numbers for white and black [pieces](Pieces "Pieces") respectively, and zero for empty squares, further a [piece list](Piece-Lists "Piece-Lists"), and multiple other [incremental updated data](Incremental_Updates "Incremental Updates"), such as [attack and defend maps](Attack_and_Defend_Maps "Attack and Defend Maps"), a change list, a list of [pinned pieces](Pin "Pin"), and pieces [en prise](En_prise "En prise"). The [move list](Move_List "Move List") for move generation is shared and controlled by indices kept on the [ply-stack](Stack#SearchStack "Stack") recursively. 



### Search


Ostrich [searched](Search "Search") a [tree](Search_Tree "Search Tree") of variable-length move sequences using [Shannon's Type B strategy](Type_B_Strategy "Type B Strategy") supplemented by the [alpha-beta algorithm](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta"). Strict [legal move generation](Move_Generation#Legal "Move Generation"), [move ordering](Move_Ordering "Move Ordering"), re-ordering and plausibility analysis took huge effort, especially at or near the [root](Root "Root").



### Search Control


The early Ostrich did not yet perform [iterative deepening](Iterative_Deepening "Iterative Deepening"), instead the search was controlled by various parameters, such as fan-out or maximum number of moves played at each level with {F1, ..., F10}, two [depth](Depth "Depth") parameters Dmin and Dmax, average move time and total time. Dmin determines the minimal depth to the [horizon](Horizon_Node "Horizon Node"). If depth is still less Dmax, positions either resulting from [tactical moves](Tactical_Moves "Tactical Moves"), or with the presence of en prise pieces were [extended](Extensions "Extensions"). Initial guesses of the parameters based on [time control](Time_Management "Time Management") were adapted during the course of the [game](Chess_Game "Chess Game") considering time usage and various [statistics](Search_Statistics "Search Statistics") . 




### Gamma-Algorithm


The **Gamma-algorithm** caused certain [futile nodes](Futility_Pruning "Futility Pruning") to be considered [leaves](Leaf_Node "Leaf Node"):



1. Determine material score at current node P[i]
2. Compare the score with the material score of the P[best] that follows by making the best move M[best] found so far at node P[i-3]
3. If the score of P[i] implies that the move sequence of M[1], M[2], M[3] is worse than the move M[best] then stop searching at node P[i]



```C++
P[i-3] : M[best] -> P[best] ...
       : M[1]    -> P[i-2] : M[2] -> P[i-1] : M[3] -> P[i]

```

### Evaluation


Processing at the [leaf nodes](Leaf_Node "Leaf Node") includes the usual [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") terms dominated by [material](Material "Material"), but also [path-dependent](Path-Dependency "Path-Dependency") terms by the move sequence from the root to this node, such as bonus for [castling](Castling "Castling") or penalties for [tempo](Tempo "Tempo") wasting moves, i.e. moving a piece to a square in two moves to which it could move in one, too early queen moves in the opening, etc.. The static evaluation function consists of thirteen subroutines each corresponding to a basic chess heuristic <a id="cite-note-15" href="#cite-ref-15">[15]</a>:



* [Material](Material "Material"). The subroutine which computes the difference between White's and Black's material the greatest single value to the overall scoring function. The pieces have their conventional [values](Point_Value "Point Value").
* Material ratio term, which computes whether an even exchange of material has occurred between the [top node](Root "Root") of the tree and the bottom position being evaluated; a bonus goes to the side ahead in material.
* [Castling](Castling "Castling").
* [Board control](Square_Control "Square Control"), which is intended to increase one's own [mobility](Mobility "Mobility") and restrict one's opponent's. There is a small bonus for each square controlled, centre squares and squares near the enemy king have the greatest score. 'Control' is defined as the ability of the piece in question to capture a hypothetical enemy piece on that square.
* [Tempi](Tempo "Tempo"). Moving the same piece twice in the opening, moving a king or rook before castling, moving a piece back to its immediately previous position and moving to a square in two moves when it could be done in one, all attract penalties.
* [Early queen](Development "Development") moves. These attract a penalty before the eighth move of the game; by which time most minor pieces are developed and the king has castled.
* [Blocking central pawns](Development#Eval_Considerations "Development"). 'Clogging' a position is penalised.
* [Development](Development "Development") of pieces. Rapid development is encouraged by giving a penalty to unmoved minor pieces or central pawns.
* [Central pawns](Pawn_Center "Pawn Center"). These carry a bonus
* [Pawn structure](Pawn_Structure "Pawn Structure"). Advancement of pawns is encouraged and doubled pawns penalised.
* [King safety](King_Safety "King Safety"). To guard against king-side pressure on the part of the opponent the program encourages its own pieces in its own king-sector.
* [Passed pawns](Passed_Pawn "Passed Pawn"). The goal is to encourage the advancement and [queening of pawns](Promotions "Promotions") along with trading off the opponent's passed pawns before they become too advanced. A passed pawn receives credit according to its advancement.


## Description 1981


Ostrich's [parallel search](Parallel_Search "Parallel Search") was elaborated by [Monroe Newborn](Monroe_Newborn "Monroe Newborn") <a id="cite-note-16" href="#cite-ref-16">[16]</a> , and a brief description of Ostrich 81 is available from the [ACM 1980](ACM_1980 "ACM 1980") tournament booklet <a id="cite-note-17" href="#cite-ref-17">[17]</a> :




```C++Ostrich 81, originally developed by George Arnold and Monroe Newborn at Columbia University in 1971, has participated in seven ACM tournaments and two world championships. Its best result was a second place finish in the [1972 ACM tournament](ACM_1972 "ACM 1972"). Ostrich 81 won 3 out of 4 points in qualifying play for this tournament among the three Canadian programs this August.

```


```C++Ostrich 81 is written in [assembly language](Assembly "Assembly") and requires 32k word of [memory](Memory "Memory") to execute. A [book](Opening_Book "Opening Book") of about 1,000 lines helps with the first few moves, when the program leaves the book, various strategies guide its play for the next dozen moves or so. The program carries out an [iteratively deepening](Iterative_Deepening "Iterative Deepening") and variable depth search examining about 20,000 nodes per three minute move. During the last few years, two of [Montreal's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal) better chess players, [Ilan Vardi](Ilan_Vardi "Ilan Vardi") and [Frank Wang](index.php?title=Frank_Wang&action=edit&redlink=1 "Frank Wang (page does not exist)"), have helped with the [openings](Opening "Opening").
