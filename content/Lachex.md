**Lachex**,   

an Acronym for [Los Alamos](Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory "Los Alamos National Laboratory") Chess Experiment, is the chess program developed by [Burton Wendroff](Burton_Wendroff "Burton Wendroff") and [Tony Warnock](Tony_Warnock "Tony Warnock"). Lachex was a mainframe program, playing on a [Cray X-MP 48](Cray_X-MP "Cray X-MP"), and was written in [Fortran](Fortran "Fortran") and [Assembly](Assembly "Assembly"), performing some kind of full width [parallel](Parallel_Search "Parallel Search") [principal variation search](Principal_Variation_Search "Principal Variation Search") inside an [iterative deepening framework](Iterative_Deepening "Iterative Deepening"). Also, Lachex already implemented presumably none [recursive](Recursion "Recursion") [null move pruning](Null_Move_Pruning "Null Move Pruning"), as mentioned in the [description](Lachex#Description "Lachex") from the [WCCC 1989](WCCC_1989 "WCCC 1989") booklet.

## Description


from the [WCCC 1989](WCCC_1989 "WCCC 1989") booklet <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>:




```C++
Lachex is specifically designed for the architecture of the Cray XMP and YMP series of machines. The highly repetitive parts of the program are written in [assembly language](Assembly "Assembly"), the rest in [Fortran](Fortran "Fortran"). Low level parallelism is achieved by extensive use of vector functional units and [pipelining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28computing%29). High level parallelism is obtained by means of multiple independent processors splitting up the search using a self-scheduling algorithm and communicating with each other through a large common [memory](Memory "Memory").

```


```C++
The search is basically [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") with [iterative deepening](Iterative_Deepening "Iterative Deepening"). In the initial depth one search each [root](Root "Root") move is actually [scored](Score "Score") and the list of moves ordered accordantly. [Best moves](Best_Move "Best Move") at subsequent iterations are moved to the top of the list. [Scouting](Scout "Scout") is used at [ply](Ply "Ply") one only - the first move in the list is scored and the remaining moves are tested with [minimal window](Null_Window "Null Window"). [Forward pruning](Pruning "Pruning") is done with a positional estimator at nodes below the horizon and with the [null move algorithm](Null_Move_Pruning "Null Move Pruning") above. Moves out of [check](Check "Check") above the horizon [extend](Check_Extensions "Check Extensions") the [search depth](Depth "Depth") for that path by one, but by two if the check is [discovered](Discovered_Check "Discovered Check") or [double](Double_Check "Double Check"). [Selective searches](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search") below the horizon include [captures](Captures "Captures"), [promotions](Promotions "Promotions"), [castling](Castling "Castling"), and some checking moves.

```


```C++
Lachex spends 1/3 of its time [generating moves](Move_Generation "Move Generation"), 1/3 doing bookkeeping, and 1/3 [evaluating](Evaluation "Evaluation") [leaf nodes](Leaf_Node "Leaf Node"). The evaluation function is symmetric wherever possible. [Mobility](Mobility "Mobility"), [pawn structure](Pawn_Structure "Pawn Structure"), [king safety](King_Safety "King Safety"), [piece placement](Piece-Square_Tables "Piece-Square Tables") and other features make up the evaluation function. Some strategy is incorporated at the root by shifting the minimal window to bias certain types of moves. There is a [transposition table](Transposition_Table "Transposition Table") which can be a big as 32 million positions, on a 64 million word machine. 

```

### Board Representation


Lachex used following [piece enumeration scheme](Pieces#PieceCoding "Pieces") from the [initial position](Initial_Position "Initial Position"), which does not change during the cause of the game: the a1-rook was labeled with 1, b1-knight with 2, a2-pawn with 9, the a8-rook with 17 and the h7-pawn with 32. Beside a [bitboard board-definition](Bitboard_Board-Definition "Bitboard Board-Definition") using 12 piece [bitboards](Bitboards "Bitboards") and [occupancy](Occupancy "Occupancy") as union set, Lachex used a redundant [8x8 board array](8x8_Board "8x8 Board"), containing those 1..32 piece-codes, but zero for empty squares, and [piece-arrays](Piece-Lists "Piece-Lists") containing [squares](Squares "Squares") and associated [piece-types](Pieces#PieceTypeCoding "Pieces") or zero if the piece is missing. A so called *INC-Array* indexed by [origin](Origin_Square "Origin Square"), [target square](Target_Square "Target Square") and [piece type](Pieces#PieceTypeCoding "Pieces") (excluding color, but white and black pawn as distinct types) was used in direct [move generation](Move_Generation "Move Generation"), similar as described in *[In Between](Square_Attacked_By#InBetween "Square Attacked By") and [Attacked by Piece on Square](Square_Attacked_By#AttackedByPieceOnSquare "Square Attacked By")*.


Further, something which reminds on [fill algorithms](Fill_Algorithms "Fill Algorithms") like [Dumb7Fill](Dumb7Fill "Dumb7Fill") was used as described by Wendroff <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>Â :




```C++
There are several methods for generating the moves of the long range pieces. The method we have had the most success with on Cray machines preceding the X-MP/48 finds the to-squares closest to the home square, and then by a complicated sequence of shifts and boolean operations simultaneously continues these moves in the appropriate directions. 

```

### BCH Hashing


To index and lock [search tables](Hash_Table#SearchTables "Hash Table"), especially the [transposition table](Transposition_Table "Transposition Table"), Lachex utilized signatures of chess positions by [BCH Hashing](BCH_Hashing "BCH Hashing") based on [BCH-Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCH_code) as used in [Error detection and correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction), otherwise [incrementally updated](Incremental_Updates "Incremental Updates") similar than signatures from [Zobrist Hashing](Zobrist_Hashing "Zobrist Hashing"). Lachex used a BCH signature length of 81 (or more) bits to protect 16 bits from the full position string of 749 (64\*12 - 2\*2\*8 + 4 + 8 + 1) bits, which is sufficient to avoid [collisions](Transposition_Table#KeyCollisions "Transposition Table") within an 8 ply search. In their paper on *Search Tables* <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a> , Warnock and Wendroff further elaborate on [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") [inconsistencies](Search_Instability "Search Instability"), and that with the introduction of search tables, depending on the implementation, alpha-beta may not be order-independent. They refer implementations given by [Tony Marsland](Tony_Marsland "Tony Marsland") <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a> and [Harry Nelson](Harry_Nelson "Harry Nelson") <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a>.
