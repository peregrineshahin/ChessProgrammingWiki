## Quotes


Quote from *Computer vs. computer: Duel on the Chessboard* <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a> on [ACM 1979](ACM_1979 "ACM 1979"):




```C++The biggest and most powerful computers do that very well. In one second, they can examine thousands of possible moves. The problem is, they stop to consider lousy moves that a human player wouldn't waste a fraction of a second on. On the other side of the fence are the slower but "smarter" computer programs. They can't think about zillions of chess moves, so they need a lot of information about chess plugged into them. CHAOS is one of these latter, pumped with chess information from John J. O'Keefe, one of Michigan's top players.
