**Kches6**, (KChes, K-Ches)  

an early chess program and [ACM 1974](ACM_1974 "ACM 1974") participant, written by primary author [Ken Presley](index.php?title=Ken_Presley&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ken Presley (page does not exist)") supported by [Jim Morris](index.php?title=Jim_Morris&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jim Morris (page does not exist)") - at that time both 21-year-old computer science students at [University of Louisville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Louisville), [Louisville, Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky) <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>. KChes ran on a [HP 2000](HP_2100 "HP 2100") under [HP Time-Shared BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Time-Shared_BASIC) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> and was a [Shannon](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon") [type B strategy](Type_B_Strategy "Type B Strategy") kind of program, relying on [forward pruning](Pruning "Pruning") of hopefully none plausible moves, and it also used [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") to prune backwards. Its author's dream, to program "[artificial Intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence")" into the machine, so that it could [learn](Learning "Learning") from its errors, correct its miscalculations, throw in creative variations to sidetrack its opponent, and eventually to win the [national computer chess championship](ACM_North_American_Computer_Chess_Championship "ACM North American Computer Chess Championship") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> was not fulfilled - on the contrary, at the [ACM 1974](ACM_1974 "ACM 1974") Kches6 lost two games with White and then withdrew from the tournament.



### Frankfort


In May 1974, beforehand the *First Annual Computerized Chess Tournament, State of Kentucky* in [Frankfort, Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfort,_Kentucky), where forerunner **KChes5** lost from a chess program of the [University of Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kentucky), KChes5 played an exhibition match versus novelist [Walter Tevis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Tevis), author of the novels *[The Hustler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hustler_(novel))* and *[The Man Who Fell to Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Fell_to_Earth_(novel))*, who had also written a number of articles on the game of chess, and later the novel *[The Queen's Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(novel))*. The exhibition match between KChes5 and Walter Tevis, was published in the [The Courier-Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Courier-Journal) <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>:

### San Diego


The [ACM 1974](ACM_1974 "ACM 1974") game between KChes6 and [Tech 2](Tech "Tech") in [San Diego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego) was mentioned in [David Levy's](David_Levy "David Levy") *Chess and Computers* concerning [time management](Time_Management "Time Management") <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>. In foresight to the [tragic round 3 game](ACM_1974#time "ACM 1974") vs. later tournament winner [Ribbit](Ribbit "Ribbit"), where Tech 2 had 45 minutes at its disposal to mate in two but lost on time - here Tech 2 already used 86 minutes for 6... exd4, leaving it only 23 minutes for the remaining 34 moves - this time aware of the short time and playing fast enough to win from KChes6.
