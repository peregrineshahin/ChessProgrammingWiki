**H8**,

a family of 8-bit [microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller), since the early 1990s developed and made by [Hitachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi), in April 2003 transferred to [Renesas Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renesas_Electronics). The chip consists of a CPU, various [read only](Memory#ROM "Memory") and [random access](Memory#RAM "Memory") [memory](Memory "Memory") variations, including [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_I/O) and [serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication) [I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output)-ports, [AD-converter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter), and [timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_interval_timer). The controller was used in several [dedicated chess computers](Dedicated_Chess_Computers "Dedicated Chess Computers") of the early 90s.

## Architecture

The basic architecture of the H8 was influenced by the [DEC](Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation") [PDP-11](PDP-11 "PDP-11"), with sixteen 8-bit registers (R0H, R0L, ..., R7H, R7L), with some instructons also accessible as eight 16-bit registers (R0 - R7), where R7 is the [stack pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#STACK-POINTER), 16-bit [program counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter), 8-bit condition code register (CCR) and a variety of addressing modes. Opposed to the PDP-11, H8 is a [big-endian](Big-endian "Big-endian") machine, since the upper 8 bits of a 16-bit word are stored at the even word address, the lower 8 bits at the odd address. The H8/300 has a [concise](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concise) set of 57 [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing)-like instructions, 2 or 4 bytes long <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. Arithmetic, logic, shift and bit manipulation instructions are performed as register-to-register operations, or with immediate data.
