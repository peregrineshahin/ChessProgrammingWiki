**Bookup**,

a chess opening database by [Mike Leahy](Mike_Leahy "Mike Leahy") which keeps [games](Chess_Game "Chess Game"), that is their [moves](Moves "Moves") along with optional annotations inside a tree structure.
Since nodes in this tree are indexed by a kind of [Zobrist key](Zobrist_Hashing "Zobrist Hashing") of a [position](Chess_Position "Chess Position"),
Bookup is able to immediately recognize [transpositions](Transposition "Transposition"), and is suited to learn and train [openings](Opening "Opening") and to investigate, analyze and expand [opening books](Opening_Book "Opening Book").
Bookup was developed since the 80s, initially under [MS-DOS](MS-DOS "MS-DOS"), and was further developed and ported to [Macintosh](Macintosh "Macintosh") and [x86](X86 "X86") PCs running [Mac OS](Mac_OS "Mac OS") and [Windows](Windows "Windows") with a modern [GUI](GUI "GUI") called [Chess Opening Wizard](index.php?title=Chess_Opening_Wizard&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chess Opening Wizard (page does not exist)") (COW) <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>.
While early Bookup was bundled with [Zarkov](Zarkov "Zarkov") as analysis engine, COW includes [Stockfish](Stockfish "Stockfish"), [Crafty](Crafty "Crafty") and [Ruffian](Ruffian "Ruffian"),
and further supports any [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol") (WinBoard) and [UCI](UCI "UCI") compatible engine <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> for analysis and looking for contradictions between game statistics and current chess theory, dubbed backsolving <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>.
