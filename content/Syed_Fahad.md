**Syed Fahad**,  

a computer chess programmer from [Indian-administrated region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir) of [Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Valley), who began chess programming at age 13 <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>. He is author of chess engines [Chesser](index.php?title=Chesser&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chesser (page does not exist)") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> and [Yaka](index.php?title=Yaka&action=edit&redlink=1 "Yaka (page does not exist)") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>. Fascinated by [bit-twiddling](Bit-Twiddling "Bit-Twiddling") along with [bitboards](Bitboards "Bitboards") and in particular [sliding piece attacks](Sliding_Piece_Attacks "Sliding Piece Attacks"), he devised the [subtraction based attack mask generation](SBAMG "SBAMG") (**SBAMG**), and wrote the bitboard [C++](Cpp "Cpp") library dubbed **M42** <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a> which offers [magic bitboards](Magic_Bitboards "Magic Bitboards"), [hyperbola quintessence](Hyperbola_Quintessence "Hyperbola Quintessence"), and SBAMG <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>. Further, Syed Fahad rediscovered the idea of [table-driven move generation](Table-driven_Move_Generation "Table-driven Move Generation") as implemented experimentally inside [Yaka](index.php?title=Yaka&action=edit&redlink=1 "Yaka (page does not exist)") which turned out to be slower than magic bitboards <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>.
