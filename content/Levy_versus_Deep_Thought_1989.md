[ End of an Era <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
**Levy versus Deep Thought 1989**,  

was a four-game match between [David Levy](David_Levy "David Levy") and [computer world champion](WCCC_1989 "WCCC 1989") [Deep Thought](Deep_Thought "Deep Thought") on December 12 and 13, [1989](Timeline#1989 "Timeline") at the fifth-floor room of the offices of the [British Computer Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Computer_Society), [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), UK. 
While [International Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE_titles#International_Master_.28IM.29) David Levy hadn't competed seriously in chess for more than ten years, Deep Thought had some recent experience in [playing Kasparov](Kasparov_versus_Deep_Thought_1989 "Kasparov versus Deep Thought 1989") and the [ACM 1989](ACM_1989 "ACM 1989"). DT was represented and operated by [Peter Jansen](Peter_Jansen "Peter Jansen"), who later told David 30 new [evaluation terms](Evaluation "Evaluation") had been added to the program prior to their match <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.

The match turned out to be the last one concerning the [Levy Bet](David_Levy#TheLevyBet "David Levy"). After his victories versus [Chess 4.7](Chess_(Program) "Chess (Program)") in [1978](Levy_versus_Chess_1978 "Levy versus Chess 1978") and [Cray Blitz](Cray_Blitz "Cray Blitz") in [1984](Advances_in_Computer_Chess_4#LevyCrayBlitz "Advances in Computer Chess 4"), and despite some preparation with [Danny Kopec](Danny_Kopec "Danny Kopec"), the still too "rusty" man made too many blunders and got crashed 0-4. Deep Thought won the [Omni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni_%28magazine%29) prize of $5,000, including $1,000 by Levy <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>.

```C++
As a side note, several people were betting on the outcome of the match, as well as on the outcome of each individual game (with professional bookmakers and everything!). Odds before the match were strongly in favor of the "Man". Another indication of the way this match was hyped up are newspaper headlines such as "Dangerous moves in a brutal game", "Man fights machine in chess war", "Computer's win marks new stage in chess" and the like.
