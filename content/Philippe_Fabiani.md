**Philippe Fabiani**,  

a French chess player and avocational computer chess programmer. 
After learning chess at age seven, his computer chess interest arouse when he owned his own first [dedicated chess computer](Dedicated_Chess_Computers "Dedicated Chess Computers"), a [Chessmaster Radiophon](Chess-Master "Chess-Master"), 
and later more advanced chess computers as well as playing chess programs on a [486](X86 "X86") [PC](IBM_PC "IBM PC"). 
Philippe started computer chess programming when he discovered [Tom Kerrigan's](Tom_Kerrigan "Tom Kerrigan") [TSCP](TSCP "TSCP") in the internet. 
He ported TSCP to [C#](C_sharp "C sharp") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> and [Pascal](Pascal "Pascal") using [Delphi 7](Delphi "Delphi"), 
which gradually evolved into his own engine, [Delphil](Delphil "Delphil") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. 






Philippe Fabiani summarized his ups and downs in chess programming with a quote by [Fyodor Dostoyevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky)
<a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>
<a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>: 




```C++But man is a fickle and disreputable creature and perhaps, like a chess-player, is interested in the process of attaining his goal rather than the goal itself. 

```
