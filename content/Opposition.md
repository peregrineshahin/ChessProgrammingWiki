**Opposition**,  
a relational geometrical property of both king [origins](Origin_Square "Origin Square"). The **direct** opposition, with the closest possible [Manhattan-distance](Manhattan-Distance "Manhattan-Distance") of two, implies both kings face each other on a [rank](Ranks "Ranks") or [file](Files "Files"). Along a common line, the so called **distant** or **diagonal** opposition have a Manhattan-distance of four, while they are particular cases of all virtual oppositions on the otherwise empty board as [intersection](General_Setwise_Operations#Intersection "General Setwise Operations") of all ranks and files with an even [rank-](Ranks#RankDistance "Ranks") or [file-distance](Files#FileDistance "Files") (including exclusive zero).


In late [endgames](Endgame "Endgame"), specially [pawn endgames](Pawn_Endgame "Pawn Endgame"), where kings may obligated to move, gaining (winning) the direct opposition is often a decisive [tactical](Tactics "Tactics") feature, when it puts the defending [side](Side_to_move "Side to move") in [zugzwang](Zugzwang "Zugzwang") to abandon opposition and to move the king away, and potentially allowing the attacking king a breakthrough to access important squares. Depending on other obstructions, similar is true for distant or diagonal opposition, as intermediate step to gain the direct opposition. Often, in rather blocked pawn endings, the attacking side may apply [triangulation](Triangulation "Triangulation") with its king to gain opposition, or in a more general sense to consider [corresponding squares](Corresponding_Squares "Corresponding Squares").
