**Tom Likens**,  

an American electrical engineer and as [AMD](AMD "AMD") employee part of the design team implementing the [Zen microarchitecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)) with the [Ryzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen) series of [x86-64](X86-64 "X86-64") CPUs, first released in March 2017 <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>. 
As computer chess programmer, Tom Likens is author of the [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol") compatible chess engine [Djinn](Djinn "Djinn"), which was his third attempt to write a chess program. 
Tom Likens has been interested in [bitboards](Bitboards "Bitboards") ever since he read the [Atkin](Larry_Atkin "Larry Atkin") and [Slate](David_Slate "David Slate") paper on [Chess 4.5](Chess_(Program)#Chess_4.0_-_4.9 "Chess (Program)") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> (circa 1978). 
In 2005, Tom was a bit tired of bitboards and learned towards some type of [0x88](0x88 "0x88") and [Vector Attacks](Vector_Attacks "Vector Attacks") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> inspired by [CCC](CCC "CCC") posts of [Christophe Théron](Christophe_Th%C3%A9ron "Christophe Théron") <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a> <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>, but finally stuck to bitboards.
