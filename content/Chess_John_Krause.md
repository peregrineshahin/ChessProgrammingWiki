**Chess**,

a chess program by [John Krause](John_Krause "John Krause"), written in [6502](6502 "6502") [machine language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) with versions for [Commodore VIC-20](Commodore_VIC-20 "Commodore VIC-20") (with at least 8 KiB expansion), [Commodore 64](Commodore_64 "Commodore 64"), [Atari 8-bit](Atari_8-bit "Atari 8-bit") and [Apple II](Apple_II "Apple II"),
published and described in the [Compute!](Compute! "Compute!") December 1984 issue. The program was printed in [Basic](Basic "Basic") syntax with machine code in [Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC#Data_manipulation) statements,
along with a leading read and [poke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE) loop, to read the data and store it as executable code in [memory](Memory "Memory").
The program applies [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") with a [depth](Depth "Depth") from two to six [plies](Ply "Ply") depending on level 1-5, and a [material](Material "Material") only [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation")
with {1,3,3,5,9}-[point values](Point_Value "Point Value"). An improved [8086](8086 "8086") version of the program for the [IBM PC](IBM_PC "IBM PC") was published a few months later <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
The C64 version was also released in 1986 as **Chess Master** by *FHD Software* <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>.
