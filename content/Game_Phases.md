title: Game Phases
---
**[Home](Home "Home") * [Evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") * Game Phases**

The textbook division of **game phases** enumerates three of them:

- [Opening](Opening "Opening")
- [Middlegame](Middlegame "Middlegame")
- [Endgame](Endgame "Endgame")

In the opening, the focus is on [development](Development "Development"), in the middlegame - on [attack](Attacks "Attacks") and defense, in the endgame - on pawn promotion and realization of the [material](Material "Material") advantage.

Whereas this definition is good enough for humans, coding it in a straightforward manner would introduce [evaluation discontinuity](Evaluation_Discontinuity "Evaluation Discontinuity") in many places. For that reason many programs define several game phases, based on the amount of [material](Material "Material") on the board.
