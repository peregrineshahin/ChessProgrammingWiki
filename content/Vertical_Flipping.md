[ Acrobatic Flip <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
**Vertical Flipping** mirrors all [pieces](Pieces "Pieces") along the horizontal axis between the 4th and 5th [rank](Ranks "Ranks"). Opposed to [color flipping](Color_Flipping "Color Flipping") it does not swap the piece colors and [side to move](Side_to_move "Side to move"), and therefor with respect to the [front span](Pawn_Spans "Pawn Spans") of [pawns](Pawn "Pawn"), is only applicable in pawn-less [endgames](Endgame "Endgame") with [castling](Castling "Castling") no longer possible, and results in an equivalent position with identical [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") and same number of attacks and moves. Along with [horizontal](Horizontal_Mirroring "Horizontal Mirroring") and/or [diagonal mirroring](Diagonal_Mirroring "Diagonal Mirroring"), vertical flipping is used in pawn-less [endgame tablebases](Endgame_Tablebases "Endgame Tablebases") to restrict a white king to the 10 squares of the a1-d4-d1 triangle of the board. 



## Flipping an 8x8 Board


An [8x8 Board](8x8_Board "8x8 Board") with a [rank-file mapping](Squares "Squares"), needs to perform an [exclusive or](General_Setwise_Operations#ExclusiveOr "General Setwise Operations") with 56 (A8 in [LERF](Square_Mapping_Considerations#LittleEndianRankFileMapping "Square Mapping Considerations")) to vertically flip square coordinates. A pure 8x8 Board may be vertically flipped that way in [C](C "C"):




```C++
int board[64], sq, s, f;

for (sq = 0; sq < 32; ++sq) {
  s = board[sq];
  board[sq] = board[sq^56];
  board[sq^56] = s;
}

```
