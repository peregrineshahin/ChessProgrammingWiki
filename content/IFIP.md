The **International Federation for Information Processing**, or **IFIP**,  
 
is an organization for national societies working in the field of [Information and Communications Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology) (ICT) based in [Laxenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxenburg), [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria). 
IFIP was established in 1960 under the auspices of [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO), under the name **International Federation of Information Processing Societies (IFIPS)**. 
The name was changed in 1961 to IFIP. The original contribution of IFIP was the definition of the [Algol 68](Algol "Algol") programming language, 
which was one of the first examples of truly international collaboration in computer science and left a durable mark on the entire field.
The IFIP sponsored and hosted the [First World Computer Chess Championship](WCCC_1974 "WCCC 1974") in [Stockholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm) as attachment of its [Sixth IFIP Congress](Conferences#IFIP6 "Conferences") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>.
