**David C. Norris**,

an American electrical engineer, software developer, computer games and chess programmer, [industrial and organizational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology) [psychologist](Category:Psychologist "Category:Psychologist"), and senior vice president of engineering at [Inovalon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inovalon).
From 1984 until 2009, David Norris served in multiple capacities at [Microsoft](Microsoft "Microsoft") and was selected as a leader in the Microsoft Engineering Excellence group, where he developed and promulgated best practices in software development processes, techniques, and tools.

## Games

In the late 80s, a group of MS developers including Norris believed that, in order for [Windows](Windows "Windows") to succeed, a grassroots effort to create simple but fun entertainment titles needed to be made, and thus "Bogus Software" was born <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. Dave Norris authored the [Mahjongg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong_solitaire) game [Taipei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Mahjong) <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>, released as part of the first [Microsoft Entertainment Pack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Entertainment_Pack) in 1989, and the chess program [Ziggurat](Ziggurat "Ziggurat"), which has been under development since its first release as **WinChess** <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a> and **Windows Chess** in the MS Entertainment Pack. To practice his programming skills and to keep his mind sharp, Dave Norris has recently re-written Ziggurat from the ground up, further under active development with the goal to enter the [World Computer Chess Championship](World_Computer_Chess_Championship "World Computer Chess Championship"), which became true at the [WCSC 2017](WCSC_2017 "WCSC 2017").
