**Belofte**, (Belofte Chess)

an [open source chess engine](Category:Open_Source "Category:Open Source") by [Yves De Billoëz](Yves_De_Billo%C3%ABz "Yves De Billoëz"), written in [C](C "C") and released under the [GPL license](Free_Software_Foundation#GPL "Free Software Foundation") v2.
Belofte is a [console application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Console_application), and supports the [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol") aka [WinBoard](WinBoard "WinBoard")/[XBoard](XBoard "XBoard") protocol, since Belofte **2.0.6** in October 2020, [UCI](UCI "UCI").

## Features

The engine supports [EPD](Extended_Position_Description "Extended Position Description") test sets and can be run with initialization files. Games are saved in [PGN](Portable_Game_Notation "Portable Game Notation") format.
PGN files can be converted into an [opening book](Opening_Book "Opening Book").
Internally, Belofte keeps a two-dimensional [8x8 board](8x8_Board "8x8 Board") performing pure [negamax](Negamax "Negamax") [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") inside an [iterative deepening](Iterative_Deepening "Iterative Deepening") framework.

## History

Development started in 2005 and version **0.2.x** made appearance on freechess.org chess server and in source code.
At that time, it was released with a custom license (but still free for the open source community). Versions **0.3** till **0.6** were converted to [C++](Cpp "Cpp") and developed under windows but compilation on other platforms failed. Source code for those versions is available. In 2017, the old version was re-released under GPL license and a new version **0.9.x** is making its appearance.
It is a branch from the **0.2** release and gradually, all changes from the **0.3+** branches will be included.
Belofte **2.0.6**, released in October 2020, was a rewrite from scratch in C++ <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
