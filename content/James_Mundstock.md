**E. James Mundstock**,  

an American computer scientist and early chess programmer. 
In the early 70s, while affiliated with [University of Minnesota](University_of_Minnesota "University of Minnesota") and its computer center under directorship of [Marvin L. Stein](Mathematician#MLStein "Mathematician") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>, 
James Mundstock was co-author of the *MNF* (Minnesota Fortran) [Fortran](Fortran "Fortran") compiler for the [CDC 6600](CDC_6600 "CDC 6600") mainframe computer <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.

Along with [Gary Boos](Gary_Boos "Gary Boos"), James Mundstock developed the chess programs [Mr. Turk](Mr._Turk "Mr. Turk") and [Iron Fish](Iron_Fish "Iron Fish"). 
Mr Turk did not use [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta"), but a search based on a *Multipurpose, Theorem-Proving Heuristic Program* as described by [James R. Slagle](James_R._Slagle "James R. Slagle") and [Philip Bursky](Philip_Bursky "Philip Bursky") in 1968 <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>, and competed at [ACM 1971](ACM_1971 "ACM 1971").
Iron Fish played the [ACM 1975](ACM_1975 "ACM 1975").



## Ostrich Effect


Quote by [Gary J. Boos](Gary_Boos "Gary Boos") on [Mr. Turk](Mr._Turk "Mr. Turk") from [Ben Mittman's](Ben_Mittman "Ben Mittman") 1971 Panel <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a> <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>:




```C++
Mundstock noticed an article by [Slagle](James_R._Slagle "James R. Slagle") and [Bursky](Philip_Bursky "Philip Bursky") in the [Journal of the ACM](ACM#Journal "ACM"), that pointed toward an algorithm that seemed better than [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") pruning. Based upon this article, and guided by Mundstock, I wrote a lookahead routine whose main theme is that the best line is analyzed until it is shown that it is no longer the best line.

```


```C++
This process eliminates many common problems that accompany a fixed depth search, one of which is the **[Ostrich Effect](Horizon_Effect "Horizon Effect")** which existed in even [Northwestern University's](Northwestern_University "Northwestern University")  [Chess 3.0](Chess_(Program) "Chess (Program)"). Tests showed that in a small set of positions, *Mr. Turk* could find the main variation on the first try. We believe that the basic theme of our lookahead routine is better than alpha-beta pruning. ...
