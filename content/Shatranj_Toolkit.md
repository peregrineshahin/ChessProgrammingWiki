**Shatranj**,  

a [bitboard-based](Bitboards "Bitboards"), chess programming [open source toolkit](Category:Open_Source "Category:Open Source") by [Sam Tannous](Sam_Tannous "Sam Tannous"), writteb in [Python](Python "Python"), 
which includes a simple chess engine which applies [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") search and [iterative deepening](Iterative_Deepening "Iterative Deepening"), 
able to communicate with a [GUI](GUI "GUI") via the [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol"). 
The goal of the project is to aid in implementing a [Shannon Type B](Type_B_Strategy "Type B Strategy") chess programs, 
where execution speed becomes less important then code clarity and expressive power of the implementation language
