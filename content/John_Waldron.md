**John Waldron**,  

a British chess player, chess consultant and apparently [opening book author](Category:Opening_Book_Author "Category:Opening Book Author") of the [Master](Master "Master") chess playing program of [Atlas Computer Laboratory](Atlas_Computer_Laboratory "Atlas Computer Laboratory") and [Harwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Research_Establishment) at [Chilton, Oxfordshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilton,_Oxfordshire), developed by [Alex Bell](Alex_Bell "Alex Bell"), [Peter Kent](Peter_Kent "Peter Kent") and [John Birmingham](John_Birmingham "John Birmingham").






Quote by [Alex Bell](Alex_Bell "Alex Bell") from *The Machine Plays Chess* <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>:




```C++In March 1974 [David Levy](David_Levy "David Levy"), the regular referee and one of the organisers of the [American ACM tournaments](ACM_North_American_Computer_Chess_Championship "ACM North American Computer Chess Championship"), rang me up - did I know of any good English chess programs? And, if so, would they like to enter the first [IFIPS](IFIP "IFIP") World Computer Chess Championship which would take place at Stockholm in August? So MASTER was entered, and for the first time we - John, Peter and myself - stopped developing the program sporadically ad hoc and seriously thought about how to improve it. One big problem was that none of us was (or is) a good chess player and by then the program was beginning to beat us occasionally.

```


```C++So a fourth member of the team was recruited - John Waldron, a sound county level player. From this point MASTER slowly began to copy Waldron's style and, with the program now searching 6 plies deep plus a crude form of a new technique (feedover), it took part in the [first World Championship](WCCC_1974 "WCCC 1974").
