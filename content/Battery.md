\[ Battery of [English cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cannon) <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
A **Battery** in chess is a formation of two or more [sliding pieces](Sliding_Piece_Attacks "Sliding Piece Attacks") with common [attacking directions](Direction "Direction") along the same [rank](Ranks "Ranks"), [file](Files "Files"), or [diagonal](Diagonals "Diagonals"). Their attacks conjoin on one or more [target squares](Target_Square "Target Square") in one [ray-direction](Direction "Direction"), attacked at least once directly, and one or more times indirectly. A battery is a chess tactics related term, often motivated by [strategic](Strategy "Strategy") [pawn structure](Pawn_Structure "Pawn Structure") related considerations. In the [middlegame](Middlegame "Middlegame"), a ([rook](Rook "Rook")) battery attacking a [weak](Weak_Pawns "Weak Pawns") opponent pawn on a [half-open file](Half-open_File "Half-open File") is a common motive. The German chess term *Drucksäule* <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> (tower of strength) refers to own, apparently weak pawn support from its [rearspan](Pawn_Spans "Pawn Spans"), to force a [lever](</Pawn_Levers_(Bitboards)> "Pawn Levers (Bitboards)") and pawn exchange to (half-) open a file.

## Evaluation Considerations

Like other [X-ray](X-ray "X-ray") related tactics, considering batteries may be subject of [king safety](King_Safety "King Safety") terms and [static exchange evaluation](Static_Exchange_Evaluation "Static Exchange Evaluation"). A standard pattern in [mate at a glance](Mate_at_a_Glance "Mate at a Glance") is a battery of [bishop](Bishop "Bishop") / [queen](Queen "Queen") or [rooks](Rook "Rook") / queen, where the queen attacks a square or opponent piece adjacent to the opponent [king](King "King"), exclusively defended.

Whether a (rook-) battery deserves a general bonus in [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") is debatable, assuming there are already singular bonuses for occupying [open- or half-open files](Rook_on_Open_File "Rook on Open File") or the [seventh rank](Rook_on_Seventh "Rook on Seventh") respectively. [Larry Kaufman](Larry_Kaufman "Larry Kaufman") even proposed a rook-pair penalty with respect to a [bishop pair](Bishop_Pair "Bishop Pair") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>:

```
In my opinion, another reason is that any other pair of pieces suffers from redundancy. Two knights, two rooks, bishop and knight, or major plus minor piece are all capable of guarding the same squares, and therefore there is apt to be some duplication of function.

```

```
With two bishops traveling on opposite colored squares there is no possibility of any duplication of function. So, in theory, rather than giving a bonus to two bishops, we should penalize every other combination of pieces, but it is obviously much easier to reward the bishop pair. 

```
