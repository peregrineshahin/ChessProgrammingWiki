**Gullydeckel**, (Gullydeckel2, Gully)

a [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol") (CEPT) compliant [open source engine](Category:Open_Source "Category:Open Source") under the [GNU General Public License](Free_Software_Foundation#GPL "Free Software Foundation") by [Martin Borriss](Martin_Borriss "Martin Borriss"), written in [C](C "C"). A first version, Gullydeckel **1**, has been developed in 1994/1995. Gullydeckel **2** was written mainly in 1996, while [Windows 32](Windows "Windows") support, analysis, [pondering](Pondering "Pondering"), [WinBoard](WinBoard "WinBoard") protocol version 2 aka CEPT and [ChessBase GUI](</ChessBase_(Database)#GUI> "ChessBase (Database)") compatibility was finally realized in 2002/2003 <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.

## 0x88 Difference

The pre-initialized static int vector[256] in "attacks.c" <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> with [ray directions](Direction#RayDirections "Direction") encoded, which is indexed by [0x88 square difference](0x88#SquareRelations "0x88") plus offset, somehow reminds on a [Gullydeckel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schachtdeckel), the colloquial German name for [Manhole cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhole_cover) <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>:

```

/*
if we find that two squares are related according to matrix SqRel,
we use another matrix to look up the direction of the move required
('to walk the vector') if it is a sliding piece (R,B,Q)
