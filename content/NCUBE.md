[ [Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_(integrated_circuit)) of nCUBE 10 processor <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
**nCUBE**,  

a series of massive parallel computers based on a [hypercube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube) topology performing [MIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMD), first released 1985 by the [company of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCUBE). The first model, the **nCUBE 10** was able to build an order-ten hypercube, supporting up to 1024 CPUs with 32-bit [ALU](Combinatorial_Logic#ALU "Combinatorial Logic") and 64-bit [FPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit) and 128 KiB of [RAM](Memory#RAM "Memory") per node, also supporting dynamic reconfigurable partitioning the machine into "sub-cubes", that is connected processor teams working on particular sub-problems, such as [searching](Parallel_Search "Parallel Search") sub-trees in the massive parallel chess program [Waycool](Waycool "Waycool") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
The single-chip **nCUBE-2** processor launched in June 1989 used [wormhole routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole_switching) with up to 4096 nodes, the 64-bit ALU nCUBE-3 was released in 1995, and the fourth generation MediaCUBE 4 in 1999. In January 2005, nCUBE was acquired by [C-COR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-COR), and subsequently acquired by [ARRIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arris_International) in December 2007 <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>.
