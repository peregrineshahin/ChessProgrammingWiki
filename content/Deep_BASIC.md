**Deep BASIC**, (Deep Basic)

a 16-bit chess program by [Thomas McBurney](Thomas_McBurney "Thomas McBurney"), written in [QuickBASIC 4.5](Basic#QuickBASIC "Basic") to run under [MS-DOS](MS-DOS "MS-DOS").
The development started in December 2002, and was the author's first attempt at a chess program, released as [open source](Category:Open_Source "Category:Open Source") in May 2003. Deep BASIC comes with an own [GUI](GUI "GUI") and features [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") with [quiescence search](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search"),
and an [opening book](Opening_Book "Opening Book"). It considers [material](Material "Material") to decide about [lazy evaluation](Lazy_Evaluation "Lazy Evaluation"), and otherwise takes positional [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") terms under account,
such as [mobility](Mobility "Mobility"), [pawn structure](Pawn_Structure "Pawn Structure") and [king safety](King_Safety "King Safety") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>.
