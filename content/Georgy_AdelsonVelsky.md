**Georgy Maximovich Adelson-Velsky**, (Гео́ргий Макси́мович Адельсо́н-Ве́льский, January 8, 1922 - April 26, 2014)

was a Soviet and Israeli mathematician, computer scientist and computer chess pioneer, most famous for inventing the [AVL tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) along with [Evgenii Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, and as co-author of the [ITEP Chess Program](ITEP_Chess_Program "ITEP Chess Program") and [Kaissa](Kaissa "Kaissa"). Adelson-Velsky and his fellow [Alexander Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod") were the last students of [Nikolai Luzin](Mathematician#Luzin "Mathematician") at [Moscow State University](Moscow_State_University "Moscow State University"), where he graduated in 1949 under [Israel Gelfand](Mathematician#Gelfand "Mathematician") on *Spectral Analysis of Ring of Bounded Linear Operators* <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>.

In the 90s, Adelson-Velsky emigrated to Israel and lived in [Ashdod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod) <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>, at times affiliated with the [Technion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology), and Mathematics & Computer Science department of [Bar-Ilan University](Bar-Ilan_University "Bar-Ilan University") <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>. Georgy Adelson-Velsky died on April 26, 2014, aged 92, in [Givatayim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Givatayim), Israel <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a> <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a>.

## Computer Chess

Since the late 50s, at Kronrod's [Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics](Institute_of_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Physics "Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics"), Georgy Adelson-Velsky worked along with Kronrod, [Alexander Brudno](Alexander_Brudno "Alexander Brudno"), [Mikhail Bongard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongard_problem), Evgenii Landis, [Nikolay Konstantinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Konstantinov), [Vladimir Arlazarov](Vladimir_Arlazarov "Vladimir Arlazarov") et al. on heuristic and game programming, where they elaborated on the foundations of computer chess. Since [1961](Timeline#1913 "Timeline") at ITEP, Georgy Adelson-Velsky co-developed the [ITEP Chess Program](ITEP_Chess_Program "ITEP Chess Program"), along with [Vladimir Arlazarov](Vladimir_Arlazarov "Vladimir Arlazarov"), [Anatoly Uskov](Anatoly_Uskov "Anatoly Uskov") and [Alexander Zhivotovsky](Alexander_Zhivotovsky "Alexander Zhivotovsky"), advised by Russian chess master [Alexander Bitman](Alexander_Bitman "Alexander Bitman"). At the end of 1966 a [four game match](Stanford-ITEP_Match "Stanford-ITEP Match") began between the [Kotok-McCarthy-Program](Kotok-McCarthy-Program "Kotok-McCarthy-Program"), running on a [IBM 7090](IBM_7090 "IBM 7090") computer, and the [ITEP Chess Program](ITEP_Chess_Program "ITEP Chess Program") on a Soviet [M-20](M-20 "M-20") computer. The match played over nine months was won 3-1 by the ITEP program. In 1971, along with [Mikhail Donskoy](Mikhail_Donskoy "Mikhail Donskoy") and [Vladimir Arlazarov](Vladimir_Arlazarov "Vladimir Arlazarov"), Georgy Adelson-Velsky became primary author of [Kaissa](Kaissa "Kaissa"), winner of the [first computer chess championship](WCCC_1974 "WCCC 1974") 1974 in Stockholm.

```C++Georgy Adelson-Velsky - one of the first Soviet programmers (together with [Alexander Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod"), [Alexander Brudno](Alexander_Brudno "Alexander Brudno"), [Evgenii Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician") and others). He was occupied by the programs, connected with [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics) at [ITEP](Institute_of_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Physics "Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics"), where he devised many algorithms which became classical. Especially the equilibrium binary trees, which in the entire world are called [AVL trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) after the names of the authors - Adelson-Velsky and Landis. After short-term teaching at [MGU](Moscow_State_University "Moscow State University") he worked at IPU and VNIISI (All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Sanitary Testing) on discrete algorithms, [network planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_planning_and_design) and [artificial intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence"). He now lives in Israel and works at [Technion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology) on [NP problems of complete tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_%28complexity%29).

## Remembering A.S. Kronrod

[Quote](Template:Remembering_A.S._Kronrod "Template:Remembering A.S. Kronrod") from *Remembering A.S. Kronrod* by [Evgenii Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician") and [Isaak Yaglom](Mathematician#Yaglom "Mathematician") <a id="cite-note-13" href="#cite-ref-13">[13]</a>:

```C++Only in 1955 did a real opportunity arise for [A.S. Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod") to work with an electronic computer. It was the [M­2 computer](M-2 "M-2") constructed by [I.S. Bruk](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/Bruk.htm), [M.A. Kartsev](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/kartsev.htm), and [N.Ya. Matyukhin](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/Matyukhin.htm) in the laboratory of the Institute of Energy named after [Krzhizhanovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleb_Krzhizhanovsky) and directed by I.S. Bruk. This laboratory later became the to Institute for Electronic Control Machines. The mathematics/machine interface was developed by [A.L. Brudno](Alexander_Brudno "Alexander Brudno"), a great personal and like­minded friend of A.S. Kronrod.

```

```C++When he started with enthusiasm to program the M­2 machine, A.S. Kronrod quickly came to the conclusion that computing is not the main application of computers. The main goal is to teach the computer to think, i.e., what is now called "[artificial intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence")" and in those days "heuristic programming".

```

```C++A.S. Kronrod captivated a large group of mathematicians and physicists (G.M. Adelson ­Velsky, A.L. Brudno, [M.M. Bongard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongard_problem), [E.M. Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician"), [N.N. Konstantinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Konstantinov), and others). Although some of them had arrived at this kind of problems on their own, they unconditionally accepted his leadership. In the room next to the one housing the M­2 machine the work of the new Kronrod seminar started. At the gatherings there were heated discussions on [pattern recognition](Pattern_Recognition "Pattern Recognition") problems (this work was led by M.M. Bongard; versions of his program "Kora" are still functioning), transportation problems (the problem was introduced to the seminar and actively worked on by A.L. Brudno), problems of automata theory, and many other problems.

## Intellectual Foundations

[Quote](Template:Quote_Yershov "Template:Quote Yershov") from *Biography AS Kronrod* by Alexander Yershov <a id="cite-note-14" href="#cite-ref-14">[14]</a>

```C++In 1958, [Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod"), Adelson-Velsky, and [Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician") selected "[Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapjack)" ("подкидного дурака") as the intellectual foundations for the development of the game heuristic programming <a id="cite-note-15" href="#cite-ref-15">[15]</a>. The program itself was a fiasco - but the basic principles (board games, [search techniques](Search "Search") and [limited depth](Depth "Depth")) were formulated. Further research laboratories in the field of game theory culminated in the first ever chess duel between the [program](ITEP_Chess_Program "ITEP Chess Program") of the [Institute](Institute_of_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Physics "Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics") of Soviet and American [best program](Kotok-McCarthy-Program "Kotok-McCarthy-Program") developed at [Stanford University](Stanford_University "Stanford University") under the direction of [J. McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy"). By [telegraph match](Stanford-ITEP_Match "Stanford-ITEP Match") was played in four games ended 3-1 in favor of our institute. At the time, chess became a [guinea pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig_%28disambiguation%29) for all programmers interested in [artificial intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence").

```C++When I was in high school I learned to program on the [M-20](M-20 "M-20") ... In the group of programmers at [Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics](Institute_of_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Physics "Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics"), where computing work was done on [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics) on the M-20, they came up with [arrays](Array "Array"), [lists](Linked_List "Linked List"), the need for [subroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine) and more. One of my teachers, Georgy Adelson-Velsky came up with a [hash memory](Hash_Table "Hash Table"). Details can be found in another of my teachers - [Alexander Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod") "Conversations about programming". Even before [Dijkstra's](Mathematician#EWDijkstra "Mathematician") basic principles of [structured programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming) was known, [Alexander Brudno](Alexander_Brudno "Alexander Brudno") published the book "Programming in meaningful notation." There was also created the first chess program ... The [chess program ITEP](ITEP_Chess_Program "ITEP Chess Program"), the predecessor of [Kaissa](Kaissa "Kaissa") fit in memory of M-20, namely in 4096 cells, each of which has a 48-bit ...

## AVL Trees

### Dinitz

Anecdote by [Yefim Dinitz](http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~dinitz/) from his talk at [Shimon Even's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Even) retiring party, November 2003 <a id="cite-note-17" href="#cite-ref-17">[17]</a>, revised version in *Dinitz' Algorithm: The Original Version and Even's Version* <a id="cite-note-18" href="#cite-ref-18">[18]</a> <a id="cite-note-19" href="#cite-ref-19">[19]</a>:

```C++The following anecdote sheds some light on how things were done in the [USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union). Shortly after the "[iron curtain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain)" fell in 1990, an American and a Russian, who had both worked on the development of weapons, met. The American asked: "When you developed the [Bomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_atomic_bomb_project), how were you able to perform such an enormous amount of computing with your weak computers?". The Russian responded: "We used better algorithms."

```

```C++This was really so. Russia had a long tradition of excellence in Mathematics. In addition, the usual Soviet method for attacking hard problems was to combine pressure from the authorities with people's enthusiasm. When [Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin) decided to develop the Bomb, many bright mathematicians, e.g. [Israel Gelfand](Mathematician#Gelfand "Mathematician") and my first Math teacher, [Alexander Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod"), put aside their mathematical studies and delved deeply into the novel area of computing. They have assembled teams of talented people, and succeeded. The teams continued to grow and work on the theory of computing.

```

```C++The supervisor of my M.Sc. thesis was Georgy Adelson-Velsky, one of the fathers of Computer Science. Among the students in his group were M. Kronrod (one of the future "[Four Russians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_Four_Russians)", i.e. the four authors of <a id="cite-note-20" href="#cite-ref-20">[20]</a>), A. Karzanov (the future author of the O(n3) [network flow algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem) <a id="cite-note-21" href="#cite-ref-21">[21]</a>) and other talented school pupils of A. Kronrod. This was in 1968, long after the Bomb project completed. The work on the foundations of the chess program "[Kaissa](Kaissa "Kaissa")", created by members of A. Kronrod's team under guidance of Adelson-Velsky, was almost finished; "Kaissa" won the [first world championship](WCCC_1974 "WCCC 1974") in 1974. Adelson-Velsky's new passion became discrete algorithms, which he felt had a great future.

```

```C++The fundamental contribution of Adelson-Velsky to Computer Science was [AVL-trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree). He (AV) and [Evgenii Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician") (L) published a paper about AVL-trees in early 60's, consisting of just a few pages. Besides solving an important problem, it presented a bright approach to data structure maintenance. While this approach became standard in the USSR, it was still not known in the West. No reaction followed their publication during a couple of years, until another paper, 15 pages long, was published by a researcher, which understood how AVL-trees work and explained this to the Western community, in its language. Since then, AVL-trees and the entire data structure maintenance approach became a corner-stone of Computer Science.

### Ershov and Shura-Bura

[Quote](Template:Quote_Shura-Bura "Template:Quote Shura-Bura") from *The Early Development of Programming in the USSR* by [Andrey Ershov](Mathematician#Ershov "Mathematician") and [Mikhail R. Shura-Bura](Mikhail_R._Shura-Bura "Mikhail R. Shura-Bura") <a id="cite-note-22" href="#cite-ref-22">[22]</a>

```C++At the end of the 1950's a group of Moscow mathematicians began a study of computerized chess. Sixteen years later, the studies would lead to victory in the [first world chess tournament for computer programs](WCCC_1974 "WCCC 1974") held in Stockholm during the 1974 [IFIP](IFIP "IFIP") Congress. An important component of this success was a deep study of the problems of information organization in [computer memory](Memory "Memory") and of various [search heuristics](Search "Search"). G. M. Adelson-Velsky and [E. M. Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician") invented the [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) ("dichotomic inquiry") and [A. L. Brudno](Alexander_Brudno "Alexander Brudno"), independent of [J. McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy"), discovered the [(α,β)-heuristic](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") for reducing search times on a game tree.

### Donskoy

[Quote](Template:Quote_Donskoy_on_AVL "Template:Quote Donskoy on AVL") by [Mikhail Donskoy](Mikhail_Donskoy "Mikhail Donskoy") from a [Radio Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty) interview on an anecdote concerning Georgy Adelson-Velsky and [AVL trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) <a id="cite-note-23" href="#cite-ref-23">[23]</a> <a id="cite-note-24" href="#cite-ref-24">[24]</a>:

```C++One of [my](Mikhail_Donskoy "Mikhail Donskoy") teachers, Georgy Adelson-Velsky, wrote an excellent report, "How did chess programs influence the development of programming". He lectured it in a strange way - at a congress in geophysics. In particular, the famous [AVL trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) were invented for chess programs at [ITEP](Institute_of_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Physics "Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics"). I happened to be in Canada with Adelson-Velsky, at the [University of Waterloo](University_of_Waterloo "University of Waterloo"), where we were invited. There are three Faculties of Computational Mathematics, one way or another related to computer science and programming. One of them is, more or less, department of AVL trees. Can you imagine the scene when Adelson-Velsky himself (AVL stands for Adelson-Velsky and [Evgenii Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician") - two authors) comes to a department bearing his name, with a head of the department, three full professors, and six assistant professors, a myriad of graduate students and all who study his works. We were seated at a place of honor. Adelson-Velsky did not speak English and I translated. They asked the fundamental question: "How do you feel about the AVL-tree today?". This was 20, maybe 30 years after the invention. Then Adelson-Velsky, a typical scientist, small and hunchbacked with glasses, said with his high voice: "Yes, AVL-trees - this was a mistake of my youth". I replied to him "Georgy Maximovich, should I translate that directly?". His honesty has always distinguished the crystal. He said yes, and I translated. Soon the department head said "You know, our guests are tired from the journey and need to rest". God forbid again Adelson-Velsky says that AVL-trees are nonsense again - their monthly salary exceeds two or three years' of Adelson's income ...

## The chronology of the events

Quotes by [Mikhail Donskoy](Mikhail_Donskoy "Mikhail Donskoy") on the [History of Kaissa](Kaissa#HistoryofKaissa "Kaissa") <a id="cite-note-25" href="#cite-ref-25">[25]</a>

```C++[1963](Timeline#1963 "Timeline") (1961) - beginning of the works on the first Soviet chess program in the [Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics](Institute_of_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Physics "Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics") (ITEP) in the laboratory under [Alexander Kronrod's](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod") management. The first authors - Georgy Adelson-Velsky, [Vladimir Arlazarov](Vladimir_Arlazarov "Vladimir Arlazarov"), [Alexander Bitman](Alexander_Bitman "Alexander Bitman"), [Alexander Zhivotovsky](Alexander_Zhivotovsky "Alexander Zhivotovsky"), [Anatoly Uskov](Anatoly_Uskov "Anatoly Uskov"), A. Leman, M. Rozenfeld.

```

```C++[1967](Timeline#1967 "Timeline") - first international match of chess programs. Competed the program ITEP and the program of [Stanford University](Stanford_University "Stanford University"), made under the management [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy"). McCarthy is famous fact that in 1952 on the beach in San Diego together with [Alan Turing](Alan_Turing "Alan Turing") devised the word combination of "Artificial Intelligence", and fact that he is the author of the language Lisp - the first programming language, specially created for the tasks in the problems of artificial intelligence. Regulations of the [match](Stanford-ITEP_Match "Stanford-ITEP Match") - four games. From the side of Stanford played one and the same version, from the ITEP side - two, which were being distinguished by the depth of search. Moves were transferred by the telegraph once a week (this to those- that times from "yadernogo" institute!). Match continued entire year and ended with the score the 3:1 in favor of ITEP.

```

```C++[1969](Timeline#1969 "Timeline") (1968) - a [letter](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BC%D0%BE_%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0_%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B8) in support of mathematician [Esenin-Volpin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Esenin-Volpin) (son of [poet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Yesenin)) and his incorrect psychiatric confinement, among others signed by [Alexander Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod") and Georgy Adelson-Velsky. As a result, the laboratory was disbanded and its major portion under [Vladimir Arlazarov's](Vladimir_Arlazarov "Vladimir Arlazarov") management, but without Kronrod, after a certain time he settled in [Institute of Control Sciences](Institute_of_Control_Sciences "Institute of Control Sciences") (ICF).

```

```C++[1970](Timeline#1970 "Timeline") - the mechanic mathematical department of [MGU](Moscow_State_University "Moscow State University") finished the entire group of the students of [Alexander Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod") and Georgy Adelson-Velsky, that was being occupied in the famous seminar for discrete algorithms. Sums of the seminar:

```C++Adelson-Velsky, an extremely capable and animated scientist and a real pleasure to meet, generally led our technical discussions. His eyes seemed to glisten with enthusiasm when he spoke. Discussions centered around probabilistic analyses of various aspects of the [minimax](Minimax "Minimax") algorithm and [parallel search](Parallel_Search "Parallel Search") of chess trees. Our first joint seminar on [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") analysis and the impact of computer technology was attended by about thirty people, including [Leonid Kantorovich](Mathematician#LVKantorovich "Mathematician"), winner of the 1975 [Nobel Prize in Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Economics) for his work on [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming).
