**Michael Levin**,  

an American computer scientist, in the 60s affiliated with [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"), and involved in the initial development of [Lisp](index.php?title=Lisp&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lisp (page does not exist)") within the group of [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy"). The 1961 memo on [Alpha-Beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") by [Daniel Edwards](Daniel_Edwards "Daniel Edwards") and [Timothy Hart](Timothy_Hart "Timothy Hart") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>, contains a Theorem by Michael Levin, the well known formula of the number of [leaf nodes](Leaf_Node "Leaf Node") that need to be examined in Alpha-Beta.



## Quotes


### Alpha-Beta


[Quote](Template:Quote_McCarthy_on_Alpha-Beta "Template:Quote McCarthy on Alpha-Beta") by [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy") from *Human-Level AI is harder than it seemed in [1955](Timeline#1955 "Timeline")* on the [Dartmouth workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop): 




```C++Chess programs catch some of the human chess playing abilities but rely on the limited [effective branching](Branching_Factor "Branching Factor") of the chess move [tree](Search_Tree "Search Tree"). The ideas that work for chess are inadequate for [go](Go "Go"). [Alpha-beta pruning](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") characterizes human play, but it wasn't noticed by [early chess programmers](Category:Pioneer "Category:Pioneer") - [Turing](Alan_Turing "Alan Turing"), [Shannon](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon"), [Pasta](John_Pasta "John Pasta") and [Ulam](Stanislaw_Ulam "Stanislaw Ulam"), and [Bernstein](Alex_Bernstein "Alex Bernstein"). We humans are not very good at identifying the heuristics we ourselves use. Approximations to alpha-beta used by [Samuel](Arthur_Samuel "Arthur Samuel"), [Newell](Allen_Newell "Allen Newell") and [Simon](Herbert_Simon "Herbert Simon"), McCarthy. Proved equivalent to [minimax](Minimax "Minimax") by [Hart](Timothy_Hart "Timothy Hart") and Levin, independently by [Brudno](Alexander_Brudno "Alexander Brudno"). [Knuth](Donald_Knuth "Donald Knuth") gives details.

```C++Many people participated in the initial development of [LISP](index.php?title=LISP&action=edit&redlink=1 "LISP (page does not exist)"), and I haven't been able to remember all their contributions and must settle, at this writing, for a list of names. I can remember [Paul W. Abrahams](Paul_W._Abrahams "Paul W. Abrahams"), [Robert Brayton](Mathematician#RKBrayton "Mathematician"), [Daniel Edwards](Daniel_Edwards "Daniel Edwards"), [Patrick Fischer](Mathematician#PCFischer "Mathematician"), [Phyllis Fox](Mathematician#PFox "Mathematician"), [Saul Goldberg](http://www.ee.calpoly.edu/faculty/sgoldber/), [Timothy Hart](Timothy_Hart "Timothy Hart"), [Louis Hodes](Mathematician#LHodes "Mathematician"), Michael Levin, [David Luckham](Mathematician#DLuckham "Mathematician"), Klim Maling, [Marvin Minsky](Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky"), [David Park](Mathematician#DPark "Mathematician"), [Nathaniel Rochester](Nathaniel_Rochester "Nathaniel Rochester") of [IBM](index.php?title=IBM&action=edit&redlink=1 "IBM (page does not exist)"), and [Steve Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Russell_(computer_scientist)).
