**Burroughs B-5500**, (B5000, B5500, B7800)

the second member of [Burroughs large systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burroughs_large_systems) in 1964, with a 3 times speed improvement of the initial **B-5000** of 1961 which was designed by chief architect [Robert S. Barton](Mathematician#RSBarton "Mathematician"), a unique machine using [discrete transistor logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_component) and [magnetic core memory](Memory#Core "Memory"), well ahead of its time.
The B-5000 family were [48-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/48-bit_computing) [stack machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine) with [multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessing) facilities, all code automatically [reentrant](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_(computing)>).
They used a partially data-driven [tagged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_architecture) and [descriptor-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burroughs_large_systems_descriptors) design, supporting exclusively high-level [programming languages](Languages "Languages").
The [ALGOL 60](Algol "Algol") dialect chosen for the B-5000 was [Elliott ALGOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_ALGOL), first designed and implemented by [C.A.R. Hoare](Mathematician#CARHoare "Mathematician") on an [Elliott 503](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_803).
All [system software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_software), such as [Burroughs MCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burroughs_MCP), was written in an extended variety of ALGOL 60, [ESPOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Systems_Problem_Oriented_Language).
The successor machines followed the hardware development trends to re-implement the architectures in new logic over the next 25 years,
with the **B5500**, B6500, B-5700, B6700, B7700, B6800, **B7800**, and finally the Burroughs A series <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
