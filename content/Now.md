**Now**,  

a chess program by [Mark Lefler](Mark_Lefler "Mark Lefler"), competing at one [World Computer Chess Championship](World_Computer_Chess_Championship "World Computer Chess Championship"), the [WCCC 1999](WCCC_1999 "WCCC 1999") in [Paderborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paderborn), and two [World Microcomputer Chess Championships](World_Microcomputer_Chess_Championship "World Microcomputer Chess Championship"), the [WMCCC 1991](WMCCC_1991 "WMCCC 1991") and [WMCCC 1993](WMCCC_1993 "WMCCC 1993"). Now further played the [ACM 1990](ACM_1990 "ACM 1990"), [ACM 1993](ACM_1993 "ACM 1993") and [ACM 1994](ACM_1994 "ACM 1994"), all three editions of [Don Beal's](Don_Beal "Don Beal") [Uniform-Platform Computer Chess Championship](Uniform-Platform_Computer_Chess_Championship "Uniform-Platform Computer Chess Championship"), the [IPCCC 1994](IPCCC_1994 "IPCCC 1994") and five [Aegon Tournaments](Aegon_Tournaments "Aegon Tournaments").


Now tied with first place among all chess programs at the [Aegon 1996](Aegon_1996 "Aegon 1996") Tournament, receiving 4.5 out of 6 points. This tied the program with other world class programs such as [Fritz](Fritz "Fritz"), and it beat Grandmaster [Larry Christiansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Christiansen) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> . Now was written in [Pascal](Pascal "Pascal"), running on [PCs](IBM_PC "IBM PC") with [MS-DOS](MS-DOS "MS-DOS") operating system. In 2007, Mark started a rewrite using [C](C "C") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> . 



### 1991


from [Don Beal's](Don_Beal "Don Beal") [WMCCC 1991](WMCCC_1991 "WMCCC 1991") report <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a> :




```C++
Written by Mark Lefler, who has spent two full-time years developing his program, and competed in [last year's ACM tournament](ACM_1990 "ACM 1990"). The [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") is mostly [piece values](Point_Value "Point Value"), with positional scores sometimes worth up to two Panws. [Search](Search "Search") techniques used include [iterative deepening](Iterative_Deepening "Iterative Deepening"), with [check extensions](Check_Extensions "Check Extensions"), no singular extensions, and [hung-piece](Hanging_Piece "Hanging Piece") extensions at depth zero. 

```

### 1993


from [Don Beal's](Don_Beal "Don Beal") [UPCCC 1993](UPCCC_1993 "UPCCC 1993") report <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a> <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>




```C++
This proginated as a [shareware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware) program by Mark Lefler, possibly going to be re-released with the latest version. The program scored equally with [GNU](GNU_Chess "GNU Chess") in the ["uniform platform" tournament last year](UPCCC_1993 "UPCCC 1993"). NOW has specialized knowledge about some Pawn and Bishop endgames. Its [search](Search "Search") mechanism includes [extensions](Extensions "Extensions") for certain [tactical](Tactics "Tactics") threats, and is [selective](Selectivity "Selectivity") in its last 3 [plies](Ply "Ply"). 

```

### 1999


from the [ICGA](ICGA "ICGA") tournament site <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a> :




```C++
General [alpha beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") searcher, with lots of [knowledge](Knowledge "Knowledge"). Has done well against humans, as evidenced by the [Aegon matches](Aegon_Tournaments "Aegon Tournaments"). 

```
