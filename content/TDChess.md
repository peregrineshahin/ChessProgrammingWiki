**TDChess**  

a chess program by [Jonathan Baxter](Jonathan_Baxter "Jonathan Baxter") based on [KnightCap](KnightCap "KnightCap") and its [TD learning](Temporal_Difference_Learning "Temporal Difference Learning") adaption for [minimax](Minimax "Minimax") search in chess, [TDLeaf](Temporal_Difference_Learning#TDLeaf "Temporal Difference Learning"). As mentioned by Jonathan, TDChess is about 5-6 times faster in [nodes per second](Nodes_per_Second "Nodes per Second") than KnightCap. KnightCap had a really complicated [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") which he had "dumbed down" a lot to get more speed. He also changed the [search](Search "Search") a fair bit, including how it does [move ordering](Move_Ordering "Move Ordering") now on the basis of a [static exchange evaluation](Static_Exchange_Evaluation "Static Exchange Evaluation"), and how [quiescence](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search") works. The sorting of moves has become lot faster due to sorting on demand. Also the [book learning](Book_Learning "Book Learning") is very different from the original KnightCap <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>. TDChess won the [NC3 1999](NC3_1999 "NC3 1999") [Australasian National Computer Chess Championship](Australasian_National_Computer_Chess_Championship "Australasian National Computer Chess Championship") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
