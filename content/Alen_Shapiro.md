**Alen David Shapiro**,

a British computer scientist, who as student of [Donald Michie](Donald_Michie "Donald Michie") at Department of Machine Intelligence at [University of Edinburgh](University_of_Edinburgh "University of Edinburgh") researched on [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) algorithms and [decision tree learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) applied to chess. Alen Shapiro and [Tim Niblett](Tim_Niblett "Tim Niblett"), another of Michie's students, adopted [Ross Quinlan's](Ross_Quinlan "Ross Quinlan") [Iterative Dichotomiser 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) (ID3) algorithm for processing complex data <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> for other employment at the chessboard, while they overcame <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> its disadvantage that it yielded massively unwieldy and incomprehensible decision-rules with *structured induction*, an interactive regime for generating machine-executable decision rules and configuring them into transparent concept-hierarchies. Niblett and Shapiro tested ID3 on the [endgame](Endgame "Endgame") of [KPK](KPK "KPK"), and found that decision trees generated by the algorithm 100% accurate.

## CLESS

In 1979/80, Alen Shapiro worked with [Ivan Bratko](Ivan_Bratko "Ivan Bratko") and [Zdenek Zdrahal](Zdenek_Zdrahal "Zdenek Zdrahal") on [Pattern Recognition](Pattern_Recognition "Pattern Recognition") applied to Chess. In fact they used [Bitboards](Bitboards "Bitboards"), called [cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) 8x8 [arrays](Array "Array"), to implement their *Cellular logic processing emulator for chess* (CLESS) <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> . CLESS used three kinds of instructions to recognize simple and more complex chess patterns:

1. [bitwise boolean operations](General_Setwise_Operations#Bitwisebooleanoperations "General Setwise Operations") without any interactions between squares
1. [shifts](General_Setwise_Operations#ShiftingBitboards "General Setwise Operations") as expand instructions
1. [fill-like](Fill_Algorithms "Fill Algorithms") propagation instructions, internally using the first two kinds of instructions and conditions in loops

## Chess Endgames

Quote by [Maarten van Emden](Maarten_van_Emden "Maarten van Emden") in *I remember Donald Michie* <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>:

```
In 1980 I spent another summer in Edinburgh as a guest of Donald Michie. Since the low point of 1975, thanks to assiduous and inventive joint pursuit of funding possibilities by Donald and [Jean](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/%7Eley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Michie:Jean_Hayes.html), the Machine Intelligence Research Unit was alive with work focused on [chess endgames](Endgame "Endgame"). There were students, including [Tim Niblett](Tim_Niblett "Tim Niblett") and Alen Shapiro. [Danny Kopec](Danny_Kopec "Danny Kopec") was there, perhaps formally as a student, but de facto as the resident chess consultant. [Ivan Bratko](Ivan_Bratko "Ivan Bratko") visited frequently. Alen was the administrator of the dream computing environment of that time: a small [PDP-11](PDP-11 "PDP-11") running [Unix](Unix "Unix").

## Structured Induction

from [computer chess: Information from Answers.com](http://www.answers.com/topic/computer-chess-1) <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a><a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>:

```
In addition to purely factual discoveries, computer programs could help the chess expert fill the gaps of which codified chess knowledge is now seen mainly to consist. Knowledge-directed programs can support his endeavours to outline the missing framework and by semi-automatic generation of descriptions from expert-supplied examples to fill empty slots in the framework as it takes shape. Using a technique of Alen Shapiro and [Timothy Niblett](Tim_Niblett "Tim Niblett") known as 'structured induction', Shapiro was able to generate a complete human-readable codification for adjudicating positions in the king-pawn–king-rook ending (pawn's side to move, pawn on a7) where none pre-existed. A side benefit subsequently extracted from this phenomenon was endowment of the program with the ability to document its own adjudications on demand with explanatory notes.

```

```
In the above-mentioned work the induction process was fuelled by hand-supplied examples. In some other cases success has been reported where the examples have been quarried by the program itself from large pre-computed databases. A recent de novo synthesis of knowledge in clinical cardiology by Ivan Bratko and colleagues employed just such an alternation between

```

```
 (i) exhaustive derivation of brute facts from a logical model and
 (ii) induction from these of an operational theory.

```

```
Sparked initially by the chess work, application is beginning to place emphasis on factual compilations as raw materials for automating the codification of new knowledge as a commercial product. The need to better understand the cognitive invariants with which the designer of codification languages must now come to terms is also leading to closer involvement of professional students of mind.

## AI as Sport

Quote by [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy") from *AI as Sport* <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a><a id="cite-note-9" href="#cite-ref-9">[9]</a>:

```
Besides AI work aimed at tournament play, particular aspects of the game have illuminated the intellectual mechanisms involved. [Barbara Liskov](Barbara_Liskov "Barbara Liskov") demonstrated that what chess books teach about how to win certain [endgames](Endgame "Endgame") is not a program but more like a predicate comparing two positions to see if one is an improvement on the other. Such qualitative comparisons are an important feature of human intelligence and are needed for AI. [Donald Michie](Donald_Michie "Donald Michie"), [Ivan Bratko](Ivan_Bratko "Ivan Bratko"), Alen Shapiro, [David Wilkins](David_Wilkins "David Wilkins"), and others have also used chess as a Drosophila to study intelligence. [Newborn](Monroe_Newborn "Monroe Newborn") ignores this work, because it is not oriented to tournament play.
