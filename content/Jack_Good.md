**Irving John (Jack) Good**, (December 9, 1916 - April 5, 2009)  

a British statistician and computer pioneer. During [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), Good worked with [Alan Turing](Alan_Turing "Alan Turing") and [Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conel_Hugh_O%27Donel_Alexander) at [Bletchley Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park), with [Donald Michie](Donald_Michie "Donald Michie") and [Shaun Wylie](Shaun_Wylie "Shaun Wylie") et al. in the section [Newmanry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmanry) headed by [Max Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Newman), contributing to crack the German [Lorenz cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_SZ_40/42) [[2]](#cite_note-2) [[3]](#cite_note-3). After the war he worked at the [University of Manchester](University_of_Manchester "University of Manchester") and [Atlas Computer Laboratory](Atlas_Computer_Laboratory "Atlas Computer Laboratory"), and had a variety of defense, consulting and academic positions, until he came to the United States in 1967, becoming a University Distinguished Professor at [Virginia Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Polytechnic_Institute_and_State_University). In 1965 he originated the concept of an [intelligence explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosion), now known as [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) [[4]](#cite_note-4), which anticipates the eventual advent of [superhuman intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence) [[5]](#cite_note-5). Jack Good died on April 5, 2009, aged 92 [[6]](#cite_note-6).

## Five-Year Plan


Jack Good was a strong chess player, and he published several papers related to computer chess in Michie's *Machine Intelligence* series [[8]](#cite_note-8), most notably his *Five-Year Plan for Automatic Chess* in 1968 [[9]](#cite_note-9), excerpts reprinted in [David Levy's](David_Levy "David Levy") [Computer Chess Compendium](Computer_Chess_Compendium "Computer Chess Compendium"), covering [Material](Material "Material"), [Quiescence](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search"), Turbulence, and Agitation [[10]](#cite_note-10).




## Theorem-Proving


Theorem-proving was mentioned in the *Five-Year Plan for Automatic Chess* [[11]](#cite_note-11):




```
Theorem-proving resembles chess Playing in that we have an objective and an analysis tree, or graph, but differs in that a superficial expected pay-off replaces the iterated [minimax](Minimax "Minimax"). The minimax idea can come in if we are trying to prove a theorem and we imagine that we have an opponent who wishes to disprove it. The value of our game is 1 if the theorem is true and — 1 if it is false. In the proof trees described in the paper by Dr D. C. Cooper [[12]](#cite_note-12) the 'and's correspond to moves of the opponent, since we must allow for both branches, whereas the `or's correspond to our own moves. The minimax (strictly maximin) value of the tree tells us whether the theorem is true, and, if we allow for superficial probabilities at the endpoints of the tree, the minimax value is the superficial probability of the theorem. 

```

## Quotes


### Jack Good


by Jack Good, 1998 [[13]](#cite_note-13):




```
In letters to [Turing](Alan_Turing "Alan Turing"), on September 16 and October 3, 1948, I mentioned the idea of resonance circuits in the brain; especially as a method for noticing analogies... In the postscript I discussed chess-playing machines, which he and I had discussed in 1941, and gave a reasonable definition of a forced variation. I took for granted the need to distinguish between quiescent and non-quiescent positions. [Shannon's](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon") paper on chess appeared in 1950.

```


```
In a letter to [F C Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Calland_Williams) in July 1951 I said "A facetious question is whether it is intended to display chess positions on the monitoring tubes". Of course today it is no longer at all facetious. 

```

### David Levy


[David Levy](David_Levy "David Levy") in *[Computer Chess Compendium](Computer_Chess_Compendium "Computer Chess Compendium")* [[14]](#cite_note-14):




```
Perhaps non-linear evaluation functions will become popular at some future date, in which case some of Good's ideas will come into their own. 

```

### The Times


Excerpt from the Obituary, [The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times) [[15]](#cite_note-15)




```
To statisticians, Good is one of the founding fathers of [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics), an approach to the discipline based on work of [Thomas Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes) in 1764. In it one forms a view of the phenomenon under study, quantifying one's uncertainty in terms of a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) (the prior distribution). One then draws a sample, obtaining data, and uses the data and [Bayes's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) to update this prior uncertainty to give a new distribution, the [posterior distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_distribution). This approach - the Bayesian paradigm, as it is now called - was little used before Good's work but was given an important boost by his 1950 book and his extensive subsequent writings, and is firmly established today. Good's other interests included [artificial intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence") - in particular, training computers to play chess and philosophy. 

```

## HAL 9000


[Marvin Minsky](Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky") and Jack Good were adviser of the 1968 [Arthur C. Clarke](Category:Arthur_C._Clarke "Category:Arthur C. Clarke") and [Stanley Kubrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick) film [2001: A Space Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_%28film%29), concerning [Self-replicating machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine) and [HAL 9000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000), the **H**euristically programmed **AL**gorithmic computer, and were referred to both in the movie and the book [[16]](#cite_note-16) [[17]](#cite_note-17).



## From Russia with Love


In 1991, Jack Good analyzed the famous position shown in the film [From Russia with Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Russia_with_Love_%28film%29), [Kronsteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_henchmen_in_From_Russia_with_Love#Kronsteen) vs. MacAdams [[18]](#cite_note-18), with the motive of the position was taken from [Spassky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Spassky) versus [Bronstein](David_Bronstein "David Bronstein") 1960 [[19]](#cite_note-19). The difference is that MacAdams had 22...Ne6. [[20]](#cite_note-20)[[21]](#cite_note-21)
