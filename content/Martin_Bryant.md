**Martin Bryant**,  

a British computer scientist, and computer chess and games programmer. In the late 70s, while affiliated with the [University of Manchester](University_of_Manchester "University of Manchester") and after some first chess programming trials, he got reawakened when he discovered a chess program listing on the university mainframe, a [CDC Cyber 72](CDC_Cyber "CDC Cyber"), apparently the version of [Chess 3.5](Chess_(Program) "Chess (Program)") which won the [ACM 1971](ACM_1971 "ACM 1971") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. 
Inspired by that listing as well as [Monty Newborn's](Monroe_Newborn "Monroe Newborn") book *Computer Chess* <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>, Martin wrote his own chess program in [Pascal](Pascal "Pascal"), dubbed [White Knight](White_Knight "White Knight"). After graduating, he started to port White Knight to [6502](6502 "6502") [Assembly](Assembly "Assembly") for an [Apple II](Apple_II "Apple II"). 
He played the [European MCC 1981](European_MCC_1981 "European MCC 1981") and soon became a professional chess and games programmer, also working for [David Levy](David_Levy "David Levy") and [Kevin O’Connell](Kevin_O%E2%80%99Connell "Kevin O’Connell") and their respective companies [Philidor Software](Philidor_Software "Philidor Software") and [Intelligent Software](Intelligent_Software "Intelligent Software"). 
In 1983, White Knight was bought by [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) for the [BBC Micro](BBC_Micro "BBC Micro") <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a> <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>, and Martin soon started with his mighty **Colossus** brand programs [Colossus Chess](Colossus_Chess "Colossus Chess"), Colossus [Draughts](Checkers "Checkers") and Colossus [Backgammon](Backgammon "Backgammon").

**Colossus Draughts** won the [2nd Computer Olympiad](2nd_Computer_Olympiad#Checkers "2nd Computer Olympiad"), [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London) 1990 in [Checkers](Checkers "Checkers") with [Chinook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinook_%28draughts_player%29) by [Jonathan Schaeffer](Jonathan_Schaeffer "Jonathan Schaeffer") et al. competing as well. Colossus was well prepared, since Checkers expert Martin Bryant recognized a weak opening move by Chinook played against another program one round before - which nevertheless could not find the refutation and lost, 
and added the winning refutation inside Colossus' opening book <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>. Martin Bryant later accepted the offer to trade Colossus' huge opening book for Chinook's six-piece databases and therefore helped Chinook to become *The World Man-Machine Checkers Champion*, and subsequently the offer to join the Chinook development team <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a> <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a>. Martin Bryant about his win at the 2nd Computer Olympiad <a id="cite-note-9" href="#cite-ref-9">[9]</a>:




```
[Paul](Paul_Lu "Paul Lu") was not playing against a group of old men who'd never seen a computer play in a competitive tournament before, but a "seasoned professional" of computer chess tournaments, where it is common practice to watch your opponents in early rounds hoping to catch them on a repeated mistake later. This has been documented to happen in computer chess tournaments so why shouldn't it happen in draughts? However, in Colossus' defense, even though I had "booked up" on the winning line, it may have been capable of finding the winning moves "across the board" anyway. After winning the game I thought to myself that it was remarkably stupid and arrogant (in the nicest possible way) of Jonathan and his team to enter a tournament with an operator who hardly knew the notation, let alone being able to recognize when his program had walked into and out of a loss! I had heard all these press "claims" by Jonathan that he'd beat the world champion in one year and solve the game in two! I had grown to love the game and knew that wasn't going to happen and so was very happy to "prove" to the world that the Chinook team still had a lot to learn about draughts.
