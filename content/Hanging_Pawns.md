**[Home](Home "Home") * [Evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") * [Pawn Structure](Pawn_Structure "Pawn Structure") * Hanging Pawns**

**Hanging Pawns** are an [open](</Open_Pawns_(Bitboards)> "Open Pawns (Bitboards)"), [half-isolated](</Isolated_Pawns_(Bitboards)#IsolanisSetWise> "Isolated Pawns (Bitboards)") [duo](</Duo_Trio_Quart_(Bitboards)> "Duo Trio Quart (Bitboards)"). It means that they are standing next to each other on the adjacent [half-open files](Half-open_File "Half-open File"), usually on the fourth rank, mutually protecting their [stop squares](Stop_Square "Stop Square"). They share a number of characteristics of weak pawns - they are not directly protected by other pawns and may become targets of attack - but unlike them they have dynamic potential of executing a pawn breakthrough and thus creating a [passed pawn](Passed_Pawn "Passed Pawn") (admittedly being an [isolated pawn](Isolated_Pawn "Isolated Pawn") at the same time). The side with hanging pawns also tends to enjoy a [space](Space "Space") advantage.

*The term "**hanging**" in chess otherwise refers attacked to [undefended pieces](Hanging_Piece "Hanging Piece") [en prise](En_prise "En prise")*.

Most of the programs do not have a special evaluation of hanging pawns, relying on search to decide if they are an asset or a liability in a given position.
