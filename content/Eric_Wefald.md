**Eric Huang Wefald**, (died August 31, 1989) <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>

was an American computer scientist and researcher from [University of California, Berkeley](University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley"), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California), who co-authored with [Stuart Russell](Stuart_Russell "Stuart Russell") on multiple papers on [search](Search "Search") control, [machine learning](Learning "Learning"), and [metareasoning](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metareasoning), that is the process of reasoning about reasoning itself.
Eric Wefald obtained a [Master of philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Philosophy) from [Princeton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University) in 1985, and was completing a doctorate in [artificial intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence") at U.C. Berkeley, when he died in a car accident near [Bordeaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordeaux), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), on August 31, 1989.

## Decision-Theoretic Search Control

Abstract from [Stuart Russell](Stuart_Russell "Stuart Russell") and Eric Wefald (**1988**). *Decision-Theoretic Search Control: General Theory and an Application to Game-Playing.* <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>:

```
In this paper we outline a general approach to the study of problem-solving, in which search steps are considered decisions in the same sense as actions in the world. Unlike other metrics in the literature, the value of a search step is defined as a real utility rather than as a quasi-utility, and can therefore be computed directly from a model of the base-level problem-solver. We develop a formula for the value of a search step in a game-playing context using the single-step assumption, namely that a computation step can be evaluated as it was the last to be taken. We prove some meta-level theorems that enable the development of a low- overhead algorithm, MGSS, that chooses search steps in order of highest estimated utility. Although we show that the single-step assumption is untenable in general, a program implemented for the game of [Othello](Othello "Othello") appears to rival an [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") search with equal node allocations or time allocations. [Pruning](Pruning "Pruning") and search termination subsumes or improve on many other algorithms. Single-agent search, as in the A algorithm, yields a simpler analysis, and we are currently investigating applications of the algorithm developed for this case.

## Optimal Game-Tree Search

Abstract from [Stuart Russell](Stuart_Russell "Stuart Russell") and Eric Wefald (**1989**). *On optimal game-tree search using rational metareasoning* <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>:

Unlike other metrics in the literature, the value of a search step is defined as a real utility rather than as a quasi-utility, and can therefore be computed directly from a model of the base-level problem-solver. We develop a formula for the expected value of a search step in a game-playing context using the single-step assumption, namely that a computation step can be evaluated as it was the last to be taken. We prove some meta-level theorems that enable the development of a low-overhead algorithm, MGSS*, that chooses search steps in order of highest estimated utility. Although we show that the single-step assumption is untenable in general, a program implemented for the game of [Othello](Othello "Othello") soundly beats an alpha-beta search while expanding significantly fewer nodes, even though both programs use the same evaluation function.
