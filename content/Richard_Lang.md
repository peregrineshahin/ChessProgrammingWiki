**Richard Lang** (born 1956),  

a British professional computer chess programmer. He is author of the mighty chess programs [Cyrus](Cyrus "Cyrus"), [Psion](Psion "Psion") and [Chess Genius](Chess_Genius "Chess Genius"), and their respective [dedicated incarnations](Dedicated_Chess_Computers "Dedicated Chess Computers"), most notably the Psion and Chess Genius programs inside [Mephisto](Mephisto "Mephisto") computers, dominating microcomputer chess in the 80s and 90s with ten [World Microcomputer Chess Championship](World_Microcomputer_Chess_Championship "World Microcomputer Chess Championship") titles in a row, from 1984 until 1995.


After first trials, Richard Lang started his computer chess programming career in January 1981 after he had absorbed [Dan](Dan_Spracklen "Dan Spracklen") and [Kathe Spracklen's](Kathe_Spracklen "Kathe Spracklen") book about [Sargon](Sargon "Sargon") which provided a complete [Z80](Z80 "Z80") [Assembly](Assembly "Assembly") listing <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> . He saw several ways to improve, not only in speed, but also in better [algorithms](Algorithms "Algorithms") and ways of obtaining a [score](Score "Score") for [chess positions](Chess_Position "Chess Position") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> . 



## Cyrus


Lang's first chess program, [Cyrus](Cyrus "Cyrus"), was written in [Z80](Z80 "Z80") [Assembly](Assembly "Assembly"). It had an astonishing debut at the [2nd European Microcomputer Chess Championship](European_MCC_1981 "European MCC 1981") at the [PCW](Personal_Computer_World "Personal Computer World") Show in September 1981 in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), winning all five games and the tournament. Lang immediately was offered two contracts by [David Levy](David_Levy "David Levy") and [Kevin O’Connell](Kevin_O%E2%80%99Connell "Kevin O’Connell"), one for Cyrus, and one to work as programmer for [Intelligent Software](Intelligent_Software "Intelligent Software"). Lang accepted, and turned his hobby into a job. Cyrus for [Sinclair](index.php?title=Sinclair&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sinclair (page does not exist)") was his first commercial entry, followed by programs for various [dedicated chess computers](Dedicated_Chess_Computers "Dedicated Chess Computers") merchandised by *Intelligent Software*, as well a further improved version of Cyrus.



## Psion


In about 1983 Richard Lang started to write his new program [Psion](Psion "Psion") for [68000](68000 "68000") based processors. He was about to abandon the work for [Intelligent Software](Intelligent_Software "Intelligent Software"), who continued their own work by owning the Cyrus brand by primary programmer [Mark Taylor](Mark_Taylor "Mark Taylor"), yielding in [Cyrus 68K](Cyrus_68K "Cyrus 68K"). Psion Chess was marketed first by [Sinclair Research](index.php?title=Sinclair&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sinclair (page does not exist)") for [Sinclair QL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL) computers <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a> and later under [Psion's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion) own label for [Apple](index.php?title=Apple&action=edit&redlink=1 "Apple (page does not exist)") [Macintosh](Macintosh "Macintosh"), [Atari ST](Atari_ST "Atari ST") and in late 1983 for the [IBM PC](IBM_PC "IBM PC") with [8086/88](8086 "8086") processors <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a> .



## Mephisto and Genius


In 1985 Lang started to collaborate with [Hegener & Glaser](Hegener_%26_Glaser "Hegener & Glaser") and [Ossi Weiner](Ossi_Weiner "Ossi Weiner"), porting [Psion](Psion "Psion") to their dedicated [Mephisto](Mephisto "Mephisto") chess computers <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a> . Psion evolved to [Chess Genius](Chess_Genius "Chess Genius"), also ported to [PC's](IBM_PC "IBM PC") for the [MS-DOS](MS-DOS "MS-DOS") operating system, and later to [Windows](Windows "Windows") <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a> . Lang's Mephisto programs dominated the microcomputer chess scene from the mid 80s until the beginning of the 90s. He was multiple [World Microcomputer Chess Champion](World_Microcomputer_Chess_Championship "World Microcomputer Chess Championship"), last title with Genius (shared with [MChess](MChess "MChess")) at the [WMCCC 1995](WMCCC_1995 "WMCCC 1995"). In 1994 during the Intel Grand Prix Cycle <a id="cite-note-9" href="#cite-ref-9">[9]</a> in London, Genius won a speed chess game (25-minutes per side) against [Garry Kasparov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov) <a id="cite-note-10" href="#cite-ref-10">[10]</a> .



## Quotes


Quote by [Kaare Danielsen](Kaare_Danielsen "Kaare Danielsen") from his [WMCCC 1987](WMCCC_1987 "WMCCC 1987") report <a id="cite-note-11" href="#cite-ref-11">[11]</a>




```C++Clearly, Richard Lang has produced the strongest microcomputer program in the world. It searches 4-5 plies [brute force](Brute-Force "Brute-Force") plus up to 6-7 plies [selective search](Selectivity "Selectivity"). The program contains a lot of [chess knowledge](Knowledge "Knowledge"), which is used both in the [tree](Search_Tree "Search Tree") and to create [piece-value-tables](Piece-Square_Tables "Piece-Square Tables"). The chess knowledge was obtained from chess masters, who analyzed games played by the program. The program has an [asymmetric evaluation](Asymmetric_Evaluation "Asymmetric Evaluation") function, which emphasis safety (has rules like 'do not start a wild attack, but worry a lot if the opponent does so'). The program searches about 4000 [nodes per second](Nodes_per_Second "Nodes per Second") on a 28 MHz [68020](68020 "68020"), but this includes a thorough analysis at every node, including a [swap-off evaluation](Static_Exchange_Evaluation "Static Exchange Evaluation") (static analysis of captures instead of a [capture search](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search")). 

```

## Resume


In 2002 Richard Lang founded his own company, merchandising Chess Genius for various platforms with focus on [PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant) and [mobile phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone), recently also for [Android](Category:Android "Category:Android") <a id="cite-note-12" href="#cite-ref-12">[12]</a> . In an 2003 interview, Richard Lang stated that there is still much of Cyrus in current versions of Chess Genius. For example, he had never used [quiescence searches](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search") and relied instead on a [static swap off routine](Static_Exchange_Evaluation "Static Exchange Evaluation"). More recently he has failed to make progress with top PC programs. In part perhaps due to his programming techniques do not scale well on very fast hardware. The program has become very complex, and unfortunately the complexity seems necessary and new ideas have not really worked <a id="cite-note-13" href="#cite-ref-13">[13]</a> .
