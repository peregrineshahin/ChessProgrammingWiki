\[ Sheraton Park Hotel <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
The [ACM's](ACM "ACM") **Ninth North American Computer Chess Championship** (NACCC) was held from December 4 to 6, [1978](Timeline#1978 "Timeline") at the [Sheraton Park Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriott_Wardman_Park), [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington%2C_D.C.), USA.

Several [celebrities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity) from the world of chess and from the computing field were attending the ACM 1978 computer chess tournament, notably [Edward Lasker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lasker), [Robert Byrne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrne_%28chess_player%29), and [ACM](ACM "ACM") president [Daniel D. McCracken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_D._McCracken), who presented trophies to the three prizewinners. Two remarkable incidents appeared in two games of the new American Champion [Belle](Belle "Belle") - in [round 2](ACM_1978#R2 "ACM 1978") versus [Chess 4.7](</Chess_(Program)> "Chess (Program)"), when Chess missed the win with 21... Nxd3, and in [round 4](Belle#Blitz "Belle") versus [Blitz 6.5](Blitz "Blitz"), which according to [David Levy](David_Levy "David Levy") produced the most beautiful combination ever played by a computer program so far <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> .

## Selected Games

In round 2, [Belle](Belle "Belle") - [Chess 4.7](</Chess_(Program)> "Chess (Program)"), Chess 4.7 played the inferior 21... Nxd3+, according to [David Levy](David_Levy "David Levy") because it considered the position after 21... Nxd3+ 22.Qxd3 dxc3 23.Qg6 cxd2+ 24.Nxd2 to be quiescent <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a> .

## Quotes

## Louis Kessler

[Louis Kessler](Louis_Kessler "Louis Kessler") with [Brute Force](</Brute_Force_(Program)> "Brute Force (Program)") suffered from a "[bug](En_passant#bugs "En passant")" twice, assumed already been fixed - he could not enter the [en passant](En_passant "En passant") moves by [Ostrich 4](Ostrich "Ostrich") and [Bs6676](Bs6676 "Bs6676") in rounds 1 and 3 <a id="cite-note-9" href="#cite-ref-9">[9]</a> :

```
 As far as the en passant bug goes, it turns out this was my own misinterpretation of the rules. I read that "The en passant capture must be done on the very next turn, or the right to do so is lost”. I had interpreted that as losing the right to do any en passant for the remainder of the game, not just for that one specific en passant. My personal lack of experience in tournament chess led to that, and it cost me. 

```

## Spracklens

Quote by [Dan](Dan_Spracklen "Dan Spracklen") and [Kathe Spracklen](Kathe_Spracklen "Kathe Spracklen") on ACM 1978 from their oral history <a id="cite-note-10" href="#cite-ref-10">[10]</a> :

```
Through Chicago, to Washington, D.C. And so, when I got to Chicago, who got on the plane but [Larry Atkin](Larry_Atkin "Larry Atkin") and [David Slate](David_Slate "David Slate"). They were sitting across, a few seats down. Yes. So, anyway, when we got there, we- and Kathy got at the airport, and then we all introduced ourselves and we told them who we were. They were really cordial to us. We thought, geez, these guys have been in computer chess for a long time, and we’re just newbies. But they were really nice to us. It was great. It made us feel like part of the crowd. So, we went to that tournament, and we were playing against big machines- Amdahl’s and Cray's, kind of like. Plus [Ken Thompson](Ken_Thompson "Ken Thompson") had his [Belle](Belle "Belle"), at the time. And so he had this T-shirt, with a cat on it, with a mouse, kind of hanging out of its mouth, and it said, How I’d love to eat the mice, eat them every one, nibble on their tiny feet- bite their little heads off. It was really gross but he thought- he had figured that we were going to be paired in the first round. He did the Swiss on it and figured that’s where we would probably end it.

```

```
I think the most exciting part for us was the last round of the tournament, when we played [Tony Marsland’s](Tony_Marsland "Tony Marsland") program [Awit](Awit "Awit"). It was a 6 million dollar Amdahl computer. And we [won the game](Sargon#Awit "Sargon"). And we were just amazed. I remember, at the time, we won it. And there was a huge audience there. There was like a hundred people sitting out there, watching it, and they just all started cheering and clapping. And then we woke up the following morning to a big article in the Washington Post that says, Microcomputer Beats 6 Million Dollar Machine, or something like that.
