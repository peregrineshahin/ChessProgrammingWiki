The **PCW Microcomputer Chess Championship** was held six times from 1978 to 1983 as part of the [Personal Computer World](Personal_Computer_World "Personal Computer World") exhibition in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom). The third event was declared the [First World Microcomputer Chess Championship](WMCCC_1980 "WMCCC 1980"), as well as the First European Microcomputer Chess Championship (inofficial ). The remaining three PCW events were further subsequently declared [European Microcomputer Chess Championship](European_Microcomputer_Chess_Championship "European Microcomputer Chess Championship"). [David Levy](David_Levy "David Levy") remarks in his 1978 report that he is beginning to prefer computer chess to competing in international tournaments <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>.



## Recruiting Ground


[Mike Watters](Mike_Watters "Mike Watters") in *Chess Computer UK* <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> :


PCW tournaments were to provide [Levy](David_Levy "David Levy") and [O’Connell](Kevin_O%E2%80%99Connell "Kevin O’Connell") with a fertile recruiting ground for proven chess programmers. For the time being though other avenues were explored. At the bottom of his article entitled ‘Chess Programming: Before You Begin’ published in the May 1979 edition of Personal Computer World, David Levy added an advertisement for programmers. At this point the [Philidor Software](Philidor_Software "Philidor Software") company was born.
