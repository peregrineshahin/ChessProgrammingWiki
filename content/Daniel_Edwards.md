**Daniel J. Edwards**,

an American computer scientist with a long-term career as a [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security) researcher at the [National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency) (NSA) <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>. In 1972 he coined the term [Trojan horse](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)>) for [malicious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) computer programs <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. In the 60s, while affiliated with [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"), he was involved in the initial development of [LISP](index.php?title=LISP&action=edit&redlink=1 "LISP (page does not exist)") within the group of [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy"). Along with [Timothy Hart](Timothy_Hart "Timothy Hart"), Daniel Edwards wrote a memo on [Alpha-Beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") in December 1961, revised version in 1963 <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>. It also contains a Theorem by [Michael Levin](Michael_Levin "Michael Levin"), the well known [formula of the number](Node_Types#LeafNodes "Node Types") of [leaf nodes](Leaf_Node "Leaf Node") that need to be examined in Alpha-Beta.

## Alpha-Beta

[Quote](Template:Quote_McCarthy_on_Alpha-Beta "Template:Quote McCarthy on Alpha-Beta") by [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy") from *Human-Level AI is harder than it seemed in [1955](Timeline#1955 "Timeline")* on the [Dartmouth workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop):

```C++
Chess programs catch some of the human chess playing abilities but rely on the limited [effective branching](Branching_Factor "Branching Factor") of the chess move [tree](Search_Tree "Search Tree"). The ideas that work for chess are inadequate for [go](Go "Go"). [Alpha-beta pruning](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") characterizes human play, but it wasn't noticed by [early chess programmers](Category:Pioneer "Category:Pioneer") - [Turing](Alan_Turing "Alan Turing"), [Shannon](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon"), [Pasta](John_Pasta "John Pasta") and [Ulam](Stanislaw_Ulam "Stanislaw Ulam"), and [Bernstein](Alex_Bernstein "Alex Bernstein"). We humans are not very good at identifying the heuristics we ourselves use. Approximations to alpha-beta used by [Samuel](Arthur_Samuel "Arthur Samuel"), [Newell](Allen_Newell "Allen Newell") and [Simon](Herbert_Simon "Herbert Simon"), McCarthy. Proved equivalent to [minimax](Minimax "Minimax") by [Hart](Timothy_Hart "Timothy Hart") and [Levin](Michael_Levin "Michael Levin"), independently by [Brudno](Alexander_Brudno "Alexander Brudno"). [Knuth](Donald_Knuth "Donald Knuth") gives details.

```C++
Many people participated in the initial development of [LISP](index.php?title=LISP&action=edit&redlink=1 "LISP (page does not exist)"), and I haven't been able to remember all their contributions and must settle, at this writing, for a list of names. I can remember [Paul W. Abrahams](Paul_W._Abrahams "Paul W. Abrahams"), [Robert Brayton](Mathematician#RKBrayton "Mathematician"), Daniel Edwards, [Patrick Fischer](Mathematician#PCFischer "Mathematician"), [Phyllis Fox](Mathematician#PFox "Mathematician"), [Saul Goldberg](http://www.ee.calpoly.edu/faculty/sgoldber/), [Timothy Hart](Timothy_Hart "Timothy Hart"), [Louis Hodes](Mathematician#LHodes "Mathematician"), [Michael Levin](Michael_Levin "Michael Levin"), [David Luckham](Mathematician#DLuckham "Mathematician"), Klim Maling, [Marvin Minsky](Marvin_Minsky "Marvin Minsky"), [David Park](Mathematician#DPark "Mathematician"), [Nathaniel Rochester](Nathaniel_Rochester "Nathaniel Rochester") of [IBM](index.php?title=IBM&action=edit&redlink=1 "IBM (page does not exist)"), and [Steve Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Russell_(computer_scientist)).
