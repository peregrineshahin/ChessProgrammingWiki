**Ross Boyd**,  

an Australian IT professional and computer chess programmer. He is author of [TRACE](TRACE "TRACE"), an acronym for **T**racey & **R**oss' **A**ustralian **C**hess **E**ngine, 
which began in November 2002 as a [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol") compatible chess engine based on [Tom Kerrigan's](Tom_Kerrigan "Tom Kerrigan") [TSCP 1.73](TSCP "TSCP") code. 
Ross Boyd has been hooked on computer chess since 1983. The desire to write a chess program drove him to learn the art of computer programming and led to a 25+ year IT career.
His first engine written in [GFA Basic](Basic#GFA_BASIC "Basic") on an [Atari ST](Atari_ST "Atari ST") chose [moves](Moves "Moves") randomly from a [list](Move_List "Move List") of [legal moves](Legal_Move "Legal Move") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
