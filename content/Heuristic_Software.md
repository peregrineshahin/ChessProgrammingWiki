**Heuristic Software**, (Heuristic Software Corporation)

an American chess and AI game developing company founded in 1981 by [Julio Kaplan](Julio_Kaplan "Julio Kaplan"), located in [Richmond, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_California). Heuristic Software evolved from a small company called *Teletape Productions* by Kaplan to develop a chess game for [Mattel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattel) <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>.

## SciSys/Saitek

In the 80s Heuristic's primary customer became [Eric Winkler's](Eric_Winkler "Eric Winkler") SciSys, in 1987 renamed to [Saitek](Saitek "Saitek"), where Heuristic's [CEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer) [Julio Kaplan](Julio_Kaplan "Julio Kaplan") and [Craig Barnes](Craig_Barnes "Craig Barnes") developed the programs of most of their [dedicated units](Dedicated_Chess_Computers "Dedicated Chess Computers"), starting with [Sensor Chess](Sensor_Chess "Sensor Chess") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, [President Chess](President_Chess "President Chess"), [Superstar](Superstar "Superstar") and [Turbostar](Turbostar "Turbostar").

## Kasparov's Gambit

In 1990, after the cooperation with Saitek declined, Heuristic Software started to focus on the upcoming [PC](IBM_PC "IBM PC") market and worked with [Don Dailey](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") and [Larry Kaufman](Larry_Kaufman "Larry Kaufman") on [Heuristic Alpha](Heuristic_Alpha "Heuristic Alpha"), which was never released but evolved to the mass market product [Kasparov's Gambit](Kasparov%27s_Gambit "Kasparov's Gambit"), distributed by [Electronic Arts](index.php?title=Electronic_Arts&action=edit&redlink=1 "Electronic Arts (page does not exist)") in 1993. Due the fall of the dedicated chess computer market, and the tough competition in the PC niche chess market, in the US dominated by [Chessmaster 3000](Chessmaster "Chessmaster") and [Battle Chess](Battle_Chess "Battle Chess"), Heuristic Software closed down in 1995.
