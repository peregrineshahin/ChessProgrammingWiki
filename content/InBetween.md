**InBetween**,  

a [Windows](Windows "Windows") [command line](CLI "CLI") utility written by [Odd Gunnar Malin](Odd_Gunnar_Malin "Odd Gunnar Malin") that can be used to translate or modify text [commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(computing)) between [client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)) and [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)), for instance between a chess [GUI](GUI "GUI") (client) and [CECP](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol") or [UCI](UCI "UCI") compliant chess [engine](Engines "Engines") (server) to fix communication incompatibilities or glitches in [protocol](Protocols "Protocols") implementations. Further, to track down possible incompatibilities, or for [debug](Debugging "Debugging") purpose <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>, InBetween allows [logging](Logging "Logging") of all the communication between GUI and engine (client, server or both), either as output to the console or optionally written into a [log file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_file). Along with [PuTTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY), InBetween may be used for fusing a Windows GUI, such as [ChessBase](ChessBase_(Database) "ChessBase (Database)") to a chess engine on a [Linux](Linux "Linux") server via a [Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
