**M-2** was a Soviet digital computer developed in the Laboratory of Electrical Systems in the Institute of Energy of the [USSR Academy of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences#USSR_Academy_of_Sciences), designed by [Isaak Semenovich Bruk](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/Bruk.htm). The M-2 development team, at different stages, of 7 to 10 engineers was lead by [Mikhail Alexanderovich Kartsev](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/kartsev.htm).

The M-2 was assembled in the period from April till December 1952, upgraded until 1956, since 1953 solving applied tasks on round-the-clock basis with fixed and [floating point](Float "Float") numbers. Instructions were 34-bit wide, had [three address codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_address_code) and 4-bit opcode. The control circuit and [ALU](Combinatorial_Logic#ALU "Combinatorial Logic") used [tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube) and [semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor) [diodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode). The internal storage devices included the main electrostatic device (standard cathode-ray tubes) that held up to 512 numbers and had regeneration cycle of 25 Âµs, and an additional magnetic drum that held up to 512 numbers and rotated at 2860 revolutions/min <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>.



## ITEP Chess Program


According to the description of the [Russian Virtual Computer Museum](Russian_Virtual_Computer_Museum "Russian Virtual Computer Museum"), the [ITEP Chess Program](ITEP_Chess_Program "ITEP Chess Program") was developed for the M-2 <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, which seems wrong since all primary sources by [Georgy Adelson-Velsky](Georgy_Adelson-Velsky "Georgy Adelson-Velsky"), [Vladimir Arlazarov](Vladimir_Arlazarov "Vladimir Arlazarov"), et al. mention the Chess Program was written for the [M-20](M-20 "M-20") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>:

We give a description of the principles used in organizing and processing information in the chess programs devised by the authors during the years 1961-6 for the electronic computer M-20.
