**M-2** was a Soviet digital computer developed in the Laboratory of Electrical Systems in the Institute of Energy of the [USSR Academy of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences#USSR_Academy_of_Sciences), designed by [Isaak Semenovich Bruk](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/Bruk.htm). The M-2 development team, at different stages, of 7 to 10 engineers was lead by [Mikhail Alexanderovich Kartsev](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/kartsev.htm). 



## ITEP Chess Program


According to the description of the [Russian Virtual Computer Museum](Russian_Virtual_Computer_Museum "Russian Virtual Computer Museum"), the [ITEP Chess Program](ITEP_Chess_Program "ITEP Chess Program") was developed for the M-2 <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, which seems wrong since all primary sources by [Georgy Adelson-Velsky](Georgy_Adelson-Velsky "Georgy Adelson-Velsky"), [Vladimir Arlazarov](Vladimir_Arlazarov "Vladimir Arlazarov"), et al. mention the Chess Program was written for the [M-20](M-20 "M-20") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>:
