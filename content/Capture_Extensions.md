**Capture Extensions** were used early in [brute-force](Brute-Force "Brute-Force") chess programs to minimize some [horizon effects](Horizon_Effect "Horizon Effect"). Due to the self-restricting nature of [captures](Captures "Captures") in Chess (max. 30 pieces may be captured per game), one may consider this a good idea. However, extending every capture was discarded by most programmers, and some constrains or conditions were applied, i.e. to extend only forced [recaptures](Recapture_Extensions "Recapture Extensions") on the same [target square](Target_Square "Target Square").

[Hans Berliner](Hans_Berliner "Hans Berliner") suggested to extend only those (re)captures, which restore the [material balance](Material#Balance "Material") at the [root](Root "Root"). Furthermore, capture extensions are often restricted to [PV-nodes](Node_Types#PV "Node Types"), or some programs assign [fractional extensions](Extensions#FractionalExtensions "Extensions") to different kinds of captures, considering [SEE](Static_Exchange_Evaluation "Static Exchange Evaluation"), [distance](Distance "Distance") of target square to the opponent [king](King "King"), recapturing on the same square, and material balance as mentioned.

A lot of todays programs, more focused on [reductions](Reductions "Reductions") rather than extensions in the [Scout](Scout "Scout") part of their [PVS](Principal_Variation_Search "Principal Variation Search"), most often don't reduce captures, which makes it a kind of implicit extension relative to reduced late [quiet moves](Quiet_Moves "Quiet Moves"). It also seems worth a try to reduce even captures with negative SEE while performing [LMR](Late_Move_Reductions "Late Move Reductions").

However, it seems important to extend captures if a transition to certain late endgames occurs. [Ed Schr√∂der](Ed_Schroder "Ed Schroder") for instance extends **three** [plies](Ply "Ply") in [Rebel](Rebel "Rebel") if entering the [pawn endgame](Pawn_Endgame "Pawn Endgame"), and the static, [incremental updated](Incremental_Updates "Incremental Updates") [score](Score "Score") dominated by [material](Material "Material") is not outside a +-3 pawn window around zero: The extension is very powerful, it will often avoid REBEL entering a lost ending and vice versa.
