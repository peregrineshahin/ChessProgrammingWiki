**Ryan Mack**,  

in the late 90s an American teen programmer and inventor of the [Reverse Bitboards](Reverse_Bitboards "Reverse Bitboards") when he was a 16 year old schoolboy. In 2000, while introducing his *Hyperbola Project*, he explained the [x XOR (x - 2)](Subtracting_a_Rook_from_a_Blocking_Piece#oxoro2r "Subtracting a Rook from a Blocking Piece") [bit-twiddling](Bit-Twiddling "Bit-Twiddling") trick as the basic idea of Reverse Bitboards, essentially [subtracting a rook from a blocking piece](Subtracting_a_Rook_from_a_Blocking_Piece "Subtracting a Rook from a Blocking Piece"), where the changed bits masked on a line remain the sliding [ray-attacks](On_an_empty_Board#RayAttacks "On an empty Board") in [positive](On_an_empty_Board#PositiveRays "On an empty Board") [ray-directions](Rays#RayDirections "Rays"). His idea to keep a [reversed or 180 degree rotated](Flipping_Mirroring_and_Rotating#Rotationby180degrees "Flipping Mirroring and Rotating") [occupancy](Occupancy "Occupancy") to apply the same trick for [negative](On_an_empty_Board#NegativeRays "On an empty Board") ray-directions to yield reversed attack bitboards, either requiring bitboard reversal or disjoint [serialization](Bitboard_Serialization "Bitboard Serialization") with reversion in the square centric world by [xor](General_Setwise_Operations#ExclusiveOr "General Setwise Operations") 63, turned out to be not that successful as the young author initially thought and claimed. However, [Hyperbola Quintessence](Hyperbola_Quintessence "Hyperbola Quintessence"), where fast vertical byteswap flipping is used on the fly to reverse [diagonals](Diagonals "Diagonals") and [files](Files "Files"), is somehow the resurrection of Ryan's ideas, vastly improved by [Aleks Peshkov's](Aleks_Peshkov "Aleks Peshkov") xor wizardry.
