**Tactical moves** in the context of chess program move classification are moves which immediate change [material balance](Material#Balance "Material") and [capture](Captures "Captures") a [piece](Pieces "Pieces") or cause a [promotion](Promotions "Promotions"). Those moves are obviously [irreversible](Irreversible_Moves "Irreversible Moves"), and are subject of [quiescence search](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search"), in particular with positive [static exchange evaluation](Static_Exchange_Evaluation "Static Exchange Evaluation").


In a wider sense, [tactical](Tactics "Tactics") moves are also [quiet](Quiet_Moves "Quiet Moves")- or [intermediate moves](Zwischenzug "Zwischenzug"), like moves (double) attacking more valuable (including [checking](Check "Check") the [king](King "King")) or hanging pieces, offer deflection sacrifices, starting a [Petite Combination](Combination "Combination") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>, or in general moves which some forced properties.
