**Boris Baczynskyj**, (1945 - 2008)

was an [Ukrainian American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_American) journalist, [FIDE Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE_titles#FIDE_Master_.28FM.29), [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia) chess legend <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, chess coach and writer. He earned a [bachelor's degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree) in [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science) from [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University) in 1967. While in college, he was active in the [civil-rights movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Civil_Rights_Movement_%281954%E2%80%9368%29) and was arrested during a protest march in [Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida). Before he became a full time chess coach, he served in the [Peace Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Corps) in [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand) <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> and was working as [stringer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stringer_%28journalism%29) in [Cambodia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia) in 1975 when the [Khmer Rouge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Rouge) overthrew the government <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>.

Along with [David E. Welsh](David_E._Welsh "David E. Welsh"), Boris Baczynskyj co-authored *Computer Chess II* <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>, and further anatomized some games of the [ACM 1984](ACM_1984 "ACM 1984"), as published in the [ICCA Journal](ICGA_Journal#8_3 "ICGA Journal"). He served as editor of [Chess Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Life), worked for Hayden Software on the [Sargon III](Sargon#Sargon3 "Sargon") manual, and was affiliated with [Fidelity International](Fidelity_Electronics "Fidelity Electronics") as chess advisor <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>, also responsible for [Fidelity's](Fidelity "Fidelity") [opening book](Opening_Book "Opening Book").

```C++
Cray has recently refurbished its [tournament book](Opening_Book "Opening Book") - as evidenced by the tricky sequence it essays here. The usual follow-up to White's second move is 3.c3, initiating the [Smith-Morra Gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Smith%E2%80%93Morra_Gambit). 3. ... e5? Probably any computer, left to its own devices, would "find" this inferior move. What chip worth its silicon could resist discerning the "key" point that Black holds its extra pawn because 4.Nxe5? is plastered by 4. ...Qa5, followed by 5. ... Qxe5,  Ahhh! But the move weakens the d5-square and the a2-f7 diagonal. That's not important to a chess computer, which, in [Valvo's](Michael_Valvo "Michael Valvo") felicitous formulation, 'just loves to eat'.

```

```C++
Machines' materialistic tendencies are one reason why humans forced-feed computers with [opening books](Opening_Book "Opening Book"). To the amazement of the [Spracklens](Dan_Spracklen "Dan Spracklen"), operating Fidelity X, their machine was now out of book. They suspected a technical failure. Actually the failure was all human. Fidelity's Chess Advisor, who had designed the book used in San Francisco, had simply failed to include Cray's opening sequence. Although White's opening is unusual, it is not unprecedented. Certainly it belonged in the book, which encompasses many thousands of moves.

```

```C++
I happen to know this story because, for almost two years, I worked as the only Chess Advisor Fidelity Computer Products ever had. Better is 3. ... Nc6, 3. ... e6, 3. ... d6, which should [transpose](Transposition "Transposition") into normal [Sicilian variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence).
