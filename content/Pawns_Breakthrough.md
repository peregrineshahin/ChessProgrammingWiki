**Pawns Breakthrough**,  

a chess tactics to establish an advanced and likely [unstoppable](Unstoppable_Passer "Unstoppable Passer") [passed pawn](Passed_Pawn "Passed Pawn") by means of a [sacrificial](Sacrifice "Sacrifice") [combination](Combination "Combination"). In its most notable form a pawns breakthrough appears with opposing [trios](Duo_Trio_Quart_(Bitboards) "Duo Trio Quart (Bitboards)") one rank apart already advanced on the other side of the board, for instance the white trio a5-c5 versus the black a7-c7. The combination starts with pushing the middle pawn which is now [rammed](Pawn_Rams_(Bitboards) "Pawn Rams (Bitboards)") with two [levers](Pawn_Levers_(Bitboards) "Pawn Levers (Bitboards)"). Black has two options to capture, and instead of a recapture finally yielding in an isolated ram, white sacrifices this pawn, and even offers a second one by pushing the [closed pawn](Unfree_Pawns_(Bitboards) "Unfree Pawns (Bitboards)") into a rammed lever.
