**Connected Passed Pawns**,

two or more passed pawns on adjacent files, either as [duo](</Duo_Trio_Quart_(Bitboards)> "Duo Trio Quart (Bitboards)") mutually protecting their [stop squares](Stop_Square "Stop Square"), or as [protected passed pawn](Protected_Passed_Pawn "Protected Passed Pawn") defended by the second passer, may advance in tandem and are more difficult to [blockade](Blockade_of_Stop "Blockade of Stop") than isolated passers. In a [chain](Pawn_Chain "Pawn Chain") they may be best countered by a bishop blocking or controlling their stop squares. The opponent king can also hold the chain on both [stop squares](Stop_Square "Stop Square"), but is often obligated to stay inside the [square](Rule_of_the_Square#TheSquareofthePawn "Rule of the Square") of the more advanced peak. Connected passers are in particularly strong in [rook endgames](Rook_Endgame "Rook Endgame"), but may be worse than two distant isolated passers in [pawn endgames](Pawn_Endgame "Pawn Endgame") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>.
