**SAM**, (SAM47, Samsung Arrangeable Microcontrollers)  

a family of [Samsung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics) [4-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-bit_computing) [microcontroller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller) (MCU) with the eponymous CPU core. The single-chip controller of the S3C7xxx, KS56C2x and KS57C2x series provide various amounts of [ROM](Memory#ROM "Memory") and [nibble](Nibble "Nibble") or [byte](Byte "Byte") addressable [RAM](Memory#RAM "Memory"), [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_I/O) and [serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication) [I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output), 8-bit timer/counter, [interrupt controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_interrupt_controller), and [LCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display) direct drive capability.
Samsung provides development tools, such as the Samsung Arrangeable Microcontroller (SAM) Assembler <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.

RAM is organized in three banks, 0, 1 and 15 of 256 nibbles each. The lowest 32 nibbles of bank 0 (000Hâ€“01FH) are used as working [registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register), 
the remaining 224 nibbles can be used both as [stack area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack) and as general-purpose data memory, bank 1 for general-purpose use and bank 15 for [memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O).
There are multiple [addressing modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addressing_mode), a 8-bit mode requires an even nibble address inside a pair of 4-bit registers.
The register area is divided into four register banks 0 to 3 selected by the register bank selection instruction (SRB n), bank 0 for the main program, 1-3 for interrupt routines.
Each of the register banks is subdivided into eight 4-bit registers A (lsn), E, L, H, X, W, Z, Y (msn) with EA, HL, WX, YZ as possible register pairs, as well as the cross mapped WL.
With appropriate instructions, registers can be manipulated as 1-bit units, 4-bit units or, using paired registers, as 8-bit units, the latter also used as pointer for indirect addressing.
Further the CPU has the obligatory 13- or 14-bit [program counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter) and 8-bit [stack pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack#STACK-POINTER), a 16-bit sequential carrier (BSC) register, and status word.
