**Alexander (Alex) Naumov**, (born 1969)

a Serbian computer scientist and as former computer chess programmer author of the chess engine [Naum](Naum "Naum"). Alex studied computer science at the [University of Belgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Belgrade) and moved to Canada in 1994, where he worked as [C++](Cpp "Cpp") and [Java](Java "Java") developer. He wrote his first logical game as a teenager for [Commodore 64](Commodore_64 "Commodore 64"), and the first game featuring [alpha-beta algorithm](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") in 1992. He started programming Naum in 2003, the first version for [Palm](index.php?title=Palm&action=edit&redlink=1 "Palm (page does not exist)") handheld computers, later ported to [x86](X86 "X86") [PCs](IBM_PC "IBM PC"), where Naum soon evolved to a top commercial chess engine <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.

## Open Source

Alexander Naumov on [open source](Category:Open_Source "Category:Open Source"), reply to [Tord Romstad](Tord_Romstad "Tord Romstad") after his announcement to release the source code of [Glaurung 0.1.5.](Glaurung "Glaurung") in 2004 <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> :

```
First of all, this post is not related to Glaurung, but to the idea of publishing the source code.

```

```
I strongly disagree with anyone publishing the source code. Winboard community mainly exists, because people enjoy running tournaments, and programmers enjoy competing in them. Publishing source code totally destroys competitive side of chess programming. I HATE [Crafty](Crafty "Crafty"), and I think it's doing a big damage to this community. You never know who stole code from it, and how much of some engine's code is stolen from Crafty.

```

```
There are probably many not so good programmers who reach the plato in their development, and then start 'borrowing' code from the open source programs, because it's the only way for them to increase the strength of their engine. What would be the purpose of publishing Glaurung's source. Crafty is already out there doing the damage. You think your code is easier to read. Great! It will help someone to steal it more easily.

```

```
If someone wants to check the basic idea's, there is [TSCP](TSCP "TSCP"). If someone wants to dig in deeper, there is Crafty. I don't think there is need for anything else. But I guess, as long as Crafty is out there, there is no reason why you shouldn't publish your own code. I just don't see the big reason for it.
