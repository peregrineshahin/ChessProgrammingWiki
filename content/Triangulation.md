[ [Gemma Frisius's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemma_Frisius) 1533 triangulation for mapmaking proposal <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
**Triangulation** in chess is an [endgame](Endgame "Endgame") related tactic to put the opponent in [zugzwang](Zugzwang "Zugzwang") by explicitly losing a [tempo](Tempo "Tempo"). Triangulation performs an artificial [null move](Null_Move "Null Move"), a [piece](Pieces "Pieces") (except [pawn](Pawn "Pawn") and [knight](Knight "Knight")) uses three moves to return to its [original square](Origin_Square "Origin Square"), while the defending side is not able to do so.


Most often triangulation occurs with the [king](King "King") in [pawn endings](Pawn_Endgame "Pawn Endgame") to "win" the [opposition](Opposition "Opposition"). [Queen](Queen "Queen")-triangulation is a theme in KQKR, as demonstrated in [Philidor's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Andr%C3%A9_Danican_Philidor) KQKR position <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, while [rook](Rook "Rook")-triangulation <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> is a motive in [rook endgames](Rook_Endgame "Rook Endgame"), and [bishop](Bishop "Bishop")-triangulation happens rarely in [bishop versus knight](Bishop_versus_Knight "Bishop versus Knight") endings <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>. In blocked [pawn endgames](Pawn_Endgame "Pawn Endgame"), triangulation and [opposition](Opposition "Opposition") is incorporated in the general concept of [corresponding squares](Corresponding_Squares "Corresponding Squares").


Triangulation, like any other zugzwang related motives, requires some care in [search](Search "Search") using [null move pruning](Null_Move_Pruning "Null Move Pruning"). Most programs either disable null move pruning completely in such late endgames, or at least perform a [verification search](Null_Move_Pruning#ZugzwangVerification "Null Move Pruning").
