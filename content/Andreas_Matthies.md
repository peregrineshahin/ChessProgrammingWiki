**Andreas Matthies**,

a German computer scientist and computer chess programmer.
He had his first computer chess experience at age 13 with a [Sargon II](Sargon "Sargon") chess cartridge for the [Commodore VIC-20](Commodore_VIC-20 "Commodore VIC-20").
At age 16, he wrote a [Connect Four](Connect_Four "Connect Four") program for the [Commodore 64](Commodore_64 "Commodore 64"), and later had some game theory lessons at the university - he graduated from [University of Kiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kiel) in 1995 <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
His interest in writing a chess engine revived much later, when someone pointed him to [TCEC](TCEC "TCEC") and the chess programming scene <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>,
yielding to the development of [RubiChess](RubiChess "RubiChess").
