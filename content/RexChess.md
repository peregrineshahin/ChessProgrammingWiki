**RexChess**,  

a commercial chess program by [Don Dailey](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") and [Larry Kaufman](Larry_Kaufman "Larry Kaufman"). The engine was written in [8086](8086 "8086") [assembly language](Assembly "Assembly"), the [graphical user interface](GUI "GUI") written in [Turbo Pascal](Pascal#TurboPascal "Pascal") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> . RexChess was the commercial successor of [Rex](Rex "Rex"), running on [IBM PC](IBM_PC "IBM PC") and compatibles under [MS-DOS](MS-DOS "MS-DOS"). RexChess played the [Aegon 1991](Aegon_1991 "Aegon 1991") with 3½ out of 6, losing from [David Bronstein](David_Bronstein "David Bronstein"), winning versus [Tim Krabbé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Krabb%C3%A9) and drawing from [Jeroen Piket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeroen_Piket), [Harvard Cup 1991](Harvard_Cup_1991 "Harvard Cup 1991"), and [Aegon 1992](Aegon_1992 "Aegon 1992").



## Quote


by [Larry Kaufman](Larry_Kaufman "Larry Kaufman") from *The Rexchess Story* <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>:




```C++The next step forward came when [Novag's](Novag "Novag") [Dave Kittinger](David_Kittinger "David Kittinger"), Don and I jointly worked out how to do an effective [selective](Selectivity "Selectivity") [search](Search "Search") program. Dave put these ideas into the [Super Expert B](Novag_Expert "Novag Expert") and [Super Forte B](Novag_Forte "Novag Forte"), while Don and I put them into Rex. So we decided to enter the [1989 World Computer Championship](WCCC_1989 "WCCC 1989") in Edmonton, although the program was very incomplete and not fully debugged. We scored 2 out of 5, around the middle of the PC programs, although our 20 MHz [368](X86 "X86") was one of the slower machines present. Soon thereafter, Don quit his job to devote 2 months full-time to completing Rex and adding features necessary for a commercial program.
