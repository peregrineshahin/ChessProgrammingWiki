**Dan Spracklen**,

an American computer scientist and microcomputer chess pioneer. Along with his wife [Kathe](Kathe_Spracklen "Kathe Spracklen"), Dan started chess programming in 1977 on a [Z-80](Z80 "Z80") based *Wavemate Jupiter III* <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> in [assembly language](Assembly "Assembly"). Their first program, [Sargon](Sargon "Sargon") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> had a one or two [ply](Ply "Ply") [search](Search "Search") without [quiescence](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search") but [exchange evaluation](Static_Exchange_Evaluation "Static Exchange Evaluation") <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>. After the success at [The Second West Coast Computer Faire MCCT](MCCT_1978 "MCCT 1978") in March 1978, and the shared third place at [ACM 1978](ACM_1978 "ACM 1978"), the Spracklens became professional computer chess programmers. Sargon II was ported to various early home computers, for instance [TRS-80](TRS-80 "TRS-80") and [6502](6502 "6502") based [Apple II](Apple_II "Apple II") <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>, as well as [dedicated units](Dedicated_Chess_Computers "Dedicated Chess Computers") as [Chafitz ARB Sargon 2.5](Chafitz_ARB_Sargon_2.5 "Chafitz ARB Sargon 2.5") <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>.

## Fidelity

After civil proceedings between manufacturer [Applied Concepts](Applied_Concepts "Applied Concepts") and their sales company [Chafitz](Chafitz "Chafitz"), who first marketed their Sargon 2.5 program, the Spracklens began their long term collaboration with [Sidney Samole](Sidney_Samole "Sidney Samole") and [Fidelity Electronics](Fidelity_Electronics "Fidelity Electronics") in the 80s. Beside other successes, their computers won the first four [World Microcomputer Chess Championships](World_Microcomputer_Chess_Championship "World Microcomputer Chess Championship"), [Chess Challenger](Chess_Challenger "Chess Challenger") the [WMCCC 1980](WMCCC_1980 "WMCCC 1980"), [Fidelity X](Fidelity "Fidelity") the [WMCCC 1981](WMCCC_1981 "WMCCC 1981"), [Elite Auto Sensory](Elite "Elite") the [WMCCC 1983](WMCCC_1983 "WMCCC 1983") and [Fidelity Elite X](Elite "Elite") the [WMCCC 1984](WMCCC_1984 "WMCCC 1984") (shared).

## Saitek

In 1989 or 1990, soon after Samole sold Fidelity to [Hegener & Glaser](Hegener_%26_Glaser "Hegener & Glaser"), Kathe and Dan Spracklen started to work for [Eric Winkler](Eric_Winkler "Eric Winkler") and [Saitek](Saitek "Saitek"), and developed a program for [Sparc](index.php?title=Sparc&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sparc (page does not exist)") processors. The loss of [Kasparov Sparc](Kasparov_Sparc "Kasparov Sparc") against [Ed Schröder's](Ed_Schroder "Ed Schroder") [ChessMachine](ChessMachine "ChessMachine") <a id="cite-note-9" href="#cite-ref-9">[9]</a> in [Madrid 1992](WCCC_1992 "WCCC 1992"), almost ended their involvement in computer chess when they didn't win that world title <a id="cite-note-10" href="#cite-ref-10">[10]</a>.

## Oral History

Excerpt from their *Oral History* <a id="cite-note-11" href="#cite-ref-11">[11]</a>:

## How it started

**Danny Spracklen**:

```
Yes, the first time I saw Kathleen, she was hunched over a chess program, or a  chessboard, in the cafeteria, studying a chess position. And I go, wow, that’s interesting. The young lady  likes chess.

```

**Kathleen Spracklen**:

```
And it should be noted that Dan and I have played- as opponents in chess, we’ve  played two games of chess. I won one and he won one, and we said, okay, good enough.

```

**Danny Spracklen**:

```
Well, I majored in math. And then when I got out of college, I looked for a job. And  McDonald-Douglas in Santa Monica, offered me a position there, as a beginning computer programmer.  So I moved up there and started learning how to program in [Fortran](Fortran "Fortran"). And I worked for them for three  years. 

```

## The Last WCCC

Q:

```
Well, what bet you? What was it? What program ended up beating you and not making it?

```

**Danny Spracklen**:

```
I think it was... the [Schroeder](Ed_Schroder "Ed Schroder") program, [Rebel](Rebel "Rebel"), or - I believe it was.

```

```
And he's still selling his program today, I think.

```

```
That was the end of it, yeah. That was our last big effort. We didn't make it and Sci Tech lost interest in us and - so we figured, well, it's been a good run, you know, let's do something else <laughter> 

```
