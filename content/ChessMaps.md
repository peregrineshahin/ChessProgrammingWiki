**ChessMaps**,

a research chess playing program by [Kieran Greer](Kieran_Greer "Kieran Greer"), written in [C#](C_sharp "C sharp"). It is testbed for dynamic [move ordering](Move_Ordering "Move Ordering") heuristics such as the [Chessmaps Heuristic](Chessmaps_Heuristic "Chessmaps Heuristic") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
<a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
The program requires the [.NET Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) and has an own [Windows](Windows "Windows") [GUI](GUI "GUI"). The ChessMaps manual credits [Beowulf](Beowulf "Beowulf") for providing the [opening book](Opening_Book "Opening Book").

## Quotes

Kieran Greer's more recent research on *Tree Pruning for New Search Techniques in Computer Games* with [move chains](index.php?title=Move_Chains&action=edit&redlink=1 "Move Chains (page does not exist)") has been carried out using Chessmaps <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>:

```C++The Chessmaps program is still only a prototype program and is missing modules or functions that would be included in a complete program. There is no real knowledge of endgame play, for example, where the program will tend to play more aimlessly and be happy to concede a draw by repetition, in a clearly winning position. On the other hand, in certain middlegame positions where its positional evaluator should work well, it does play strongly. It is still a bit buggy and can produce errors, but the testing and results have been performed under reliable circumstances. So a rough evaluation of playing strength might be a strong club player, although, this is not particularly strong for computer chess programs these days.
