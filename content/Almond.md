**Almond**,

a [Clone](Category:Clone "Category:Clone") of [Mark Lefler's](Mark_Lefler "Mark Lefler") program [Now](Now "Now"), by fake author "Richard Hall"
<a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>,
an alleged student from [University of Michigan](University_of_Michigan "University of Michigan"), who asked the [CSVN](CSVN "CSVN") via [Jan Krabbenbos](Jan_Krabbenbos "Jan Krabbenbos") and [Hans Secelle](Hans_Secelle "Hans Secelle") to play the [ICT 2010](ICT_2010 "ICT 2010").
"Richard Hall" further sent another version (?) of Almond to [Jim Ablett](Jim_Ablett "Jim Ablett") which appeared to be a clone of an early version of the [Myrddin](Myrddin "Myrddin") engine by [John Merlino](John_Merlino "John Merlino"),
as confirmed by John, giving some details about the culprit
<a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. The cloner made only the tiniest attempt to modify the source, even keeping all of internal comments, such as thanking the [Chessmaster](Chessmaster "Chessmaster") development team!
The "successor" of Almond, [Scaramanga](Scaramanga "Scaramanga"), played the [DOCCC 2010](DOCCC_2010 "DOCCC 2010"), also operated by [Hans Secelle](Hans_Secelle "Hans Secelle") who regularly contacted "Richard Hall"
<a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>.
[Harvey Williamson](Harvey_Williamson "Harvey Williamson") raised suspicions after *Scaramanga* was connected from an Indian server at [Playchess](index.php?title=Playchess&action=edit&redlink=1 "Playchess (page does not exist)"), and [Hans Secelle](Hans_Secelle "Hans Secelle") sent the source code applied to [Don Dailey](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") forwarded for confirmation to Mark Lefler.
Mark admitted he had naively shared his source code with someone who said he was named "Chinmay" who offered to run Now in a tournament with faster hardware and better compiler,
and said he had operated [Rybka](Rybka "Rybka") at [ACCA 2008](ACCA_2008 "ACCA 2008") <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>.
