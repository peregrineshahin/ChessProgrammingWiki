**Planner**,  

[Jonathan Schaeffer's](Jonathan_Schaeffer "Jonathan Schaeffer") first chess program. When Schaeffer started studying computer science at the [University of Waterloo](University_of_Waterloo "University of Waterloo") in 1979, he met [Ron Hansen](Ron_Hansen "Ron Hansen"), co-author of [Ribbit](Ribbit "Ribbit") and [Treefrog](Treefrog "Treefrog"), who generously gave him a copy of his program, which Schaeffer used to learn how to write a chess program. 
For his master's thesis, he translated the [Fortran](Fortran "Fortran") program into the Z programming language (similar to the well known [C](C "C") programming language), as a code base to implement own [chess knowledge](Knowledge "Knowledge") and [long range planning](Planning "Planning").

My time at [Waterloo](University_of_Waterloo "University of Waterloo") greatly benefited from the presence of [Ron Hansen](Ron_Hansen "Ron Hansen"). He was author of [Ribbit](Ribbit "Ribbit") (later called [Treefrog](Treefrog "Treefrog")), one of the strongest chess programs around. He generously gave me a copy of his program, which I used to learn how to write a chess program... Hansen's program was written in a computer programming language called [Fortran](Fortran "Fortran"). For my master's thesis, I translated it into the Z programming language (similar to the well known [C](C "C") programming language).

Everything I read about chess programs convinced me that they were ignorant; they had little in the way of chess knowledge. Of course, since I knew a lot about chess, it would be a simple matter of translating my expertise into code and voil√†, success! I spent a year working on the program, adding as much knowledge as I could to it. The new program, dubbed Planner, failed to live up to my performance expectations. Gradually my enthusiasm began to wave. The chess knowledge that I had added was simple because important concepts seemed hard to program. The machine required a precise specification but my chess knowledge was imprecise. Further, for every piece of knowledge  that I added, there always seemed to be an endless stream of exceptions. This was going to be harder than I thought.

I finished my master's thesis, titled *Long Range Planning in Computer Chess*, and graduated in 1980. <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>
