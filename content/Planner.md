**Planner**,  

[Jonathan Schaeffer's](Jonathan_Schaeffer "Jonathan Schaeffer") first chess program. When Schaeffer started studying computer science at the [University of Waterloo](University_of_Waterloo "University of Waterloo") in 1979, he met [Ron Hansen](Ron_Hansen "Ron Hansen"), co-author of [Ribbit](Ribbit "Ribbit") and [Treefrog](Treefrog "Treefrog"), who generously gave him a copy of his program, which Schaeffer used to learn how to write a chess program. 
For his master's thesis, he translated the [Fortran](Fortran "Fortran") program into the Z programming language (similar to the well known [C](C "C") programming language), as a code base to implement own [chess knowledge](Knowledge "Knowledge") and [long range planning](Planning "Planning").
