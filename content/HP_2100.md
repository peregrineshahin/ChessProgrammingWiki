**HP 2100**,

a series of [16-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit_computing) [minicomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicomputer) that were produced by [Hewlett-Packard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard) from the mid-1960s to early 1990s <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. Starting with the 10 MHz **HP 2116A** with 4K [words](Word "Word") in 1966, the **HP 2100** was released in 1971, had memory protect, dual channel [DMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access) and an optional hardware [floating point processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit).
The HP 2100 used 15-bits addresses for up to 32k words of [core memory](Memory#Core "Memory"). The machine had no [stack](Stack "Stack") for [subroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine) and no internal support for [re-entrant](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrancy_(computing)>) code.
Most processing is handled in the A and B 16-bit [registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register), also accessible at memory locations 0 and 1. The CPU further had registers with a current memory address (M), its content (T) and a [program counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter) (P) and [flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_register).
