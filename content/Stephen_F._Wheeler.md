**Stephen F. Wheeler**,  

an American computer scientist and senior professor of information systems at the graduate level at [DeVry University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeVry_University) [Irving, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving,_Texas) campus, 
with expertise in [artificial intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence") and computer games. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in CS and mathematics, as well as a Master's degree in computer science and AI from [Texas A&M University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A%26M_University%E2%80%93Commerce) in 1985, 
and a Ph.D. in AI from [Walden University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden_University) in 1992. As part of his M.Sc. research on [Alpha-Beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") performance, he developed the chess playing program, which later evolved to [HAL](HAL "HAL") (Heuristic Associative Linear-algorithm) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
Stephen Wheeler was actor in [Andrew Bujalski's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bujalski) 2013 feature film [Computer Chess](History#ComputerChess "History") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>.



### Purpose of the Study



```C++
The purpose of this research was to provide a performance benchmark of the [Alpha-Beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") procedure, on [depth-first](Depth-First "Depth-First") randomly ordered game-trees with non-uniform [depth](Depth "Depth") and branching characteristics within the actual game-playing environment of computer chess. Although both theoretical and empirical studies have been performed to evaluate the efficiency of the Alpha-Beta algorithm, this research represents the first of its kind to establish the performance characteristics of the Alpha-Beta procedure within the specific problem domain of this study. 

```

### Procedure



```C++
A search of technical literature was performed to determine the research done to date with regard to the Alpha-Beta algorithm, and to ascertain the results obtained.  Modifications were made to the author's chess program to report Alpha-Beta pruning statistics to be used for an empirical evaluation of the algorithm's performance as compared to the unaided [Minimax](Minimax "Minimax") tree search algorithm.

```

### Findings and Conclusions



```C++
Research literature indicates that the Alpha-Beta algorithm is asymptotically optimal among all directional algorithms. No algorithm demonstrated better performance than the Alpha-Beta algorithm on uniform perfectly-ordered depth-first game trees.

```


```C++
Chess programs generate non-uniform game trees. This author's research on such trees, generated to a minimum depth of two-ply and a maximum depth of four-ply with random ordering, indicates that the Alpha-Beta procedure provides a three-to one-improvement over the minimax procedure. The author has also demonstrated by empirical research that the number of bottom nodes evaluated by Alpha-Beta on such trees is roughly equal to 2b(3/4)d, where b is the [average branching factor](Branching_Factor#Average_Branching_Factor "Branching Factor") and d is the average depth of search, and fits well within the asymptotic upper bound described by [Knuth](Donald_Knuth "Donald Knuth") and Moore of (b/log b)d for the size and type of game trees investigated by this research.
