**Reversible Moves** are all moves by [pieces](Pieces "Pieces") (except [pawns](Pawn "Pawn")) to empty target [squares](Squares "Squares"), thus the complement set of the [irreversible moves](Irreversible_Moves "Irreversible Moves") of [captures](Captures "Captures") and [pawn moves](Pawn_Push "Pawn Push") (including [promotions](Promotions "Promotions")). [Making](Make_Move "Make Move") reversible moves increments the [halfmove clock](Halfmove_Clock "Halfmove Clock") inside a [chess position](Chess_Position "Chess Position") object, concerning the [fifty-move rule](Fifty-move_Rule "Fifty-move Rule").


Reversible Moves in this sense may otherwise not strictly reversible if they lose the [castling rights](Castling_Rights "Castling Rights"), that is [rook](Rook "Rook")- and [king](King "King")-moves from their initial [squares](Squares "Squares"), including [castling](Castling "Castling") itself. They are irreversible in the sense of reversing the same rights - since once a castling right is lost, it is lost forever, as considered in detecting [repetitions](Repetitions "Repetitions"). However, those moves don't reset, but increment the [halfmove clock](Halfmove_Clock "Halfmove Clock") as well.
