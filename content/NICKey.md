**NIC-Key**,  

a system of classification for chess openings, variations and subvariations by [NICBase](NICBase "NICBase"), [New In Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_In_Chess). Instead of the abstract [ECO](ECO "ECO") codes like 'A' to 'E', the openings are given lettercombinations that follow directly from the descriptive opening names, like 'SI" for the Sicilian Defence and 'KI' for the King's Indian Defence. Variations and subvariations are given numbercombinations that enable it to give every sub(sub)variation a unique code. The NIC-Key has been used internationally since 1984 and according to the NIC-site, is still evolving <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> .
