## Descriptions


### 1991


from [ICCA Journal, Vol. 14, No. 2](ICGA_Journal#14_2 "ICGA Journal") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>




```C++Written by Marty Hirsch, an expert [IBM-PC](IBM_PC "IBM PC") programmer previously known for a program called [AI-Chess](AI_Chess "AI Chess"), M-Chess is a new program that has taken 3 man-years to develop. By means of logical switches in the [evaluator](Evaluation "Evaluation"), the program dynamically selects a set of heuristics depending on the [type of position](Game_Phases "Game Phases") (early [opening](Opening "Opening"), late opening, early [middle game](Middlegame "Middlegame"), late middle game, [endgame](Endgame "Endgame"), several specific endgames). [Development](Development "Development") is stressed in the opening, [king safety](King_Safety "King Safety") and [mobility](Mobility "Mobility") in the middle game, and [passed pawns](Passed_Pawn "Passed Pawn") and an [active king](King_Centralization "King Centralization") in the endgame. A [small hash table](Pawn_Hash_Table "Pawn Hash Table") is used for [pawn-structure](Pawn_Structure "Pawn Structure") evaluation. Positional evaluation can exceed the value of a pawn. The [search](Search "Search") techniques include [check extensions](Check_Extensions "Check Extensions") and [capture extensions](Capture_Extensions "Capture Extensions"), but no [singular extensions](Singular_Extensions "Singular Extensions"). The [main hash table](Transposition_Table "Transposition Table") is only used during the full-width portion of the search and does not record the [best move](Best_Move "Best Move") from previous [iterations](Iterative_Deepening "Iterative Deepening"). [Move ordering](Move_Ordering "Move Ordering") is obtained from the [principal variation](Principal_Variation "Principal Variation") and a modified [history heuristic](History_Heuristic "History Heuristic"). 

```

### 1995


from [ICCA Journal, Vol. 18, No. 2](ICGA_Journal#14_2 "ICGA Journal") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>:
