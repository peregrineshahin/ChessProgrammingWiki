## Chess

Ed Northam was an avid chess player, competing in tournaments in the 1950s and 1960s and conducting research into [chess game variants](Games#ChessVariants "Games") including [Chess960](Chess960 "Chess960") where he created new methods that can be used by players to determine the starting positions of their pieces. He also enjoyed the game of [Go](Go "Go"). His colleagues in computer chess included [Hans Berliner](Hans_Berliner "Hans Berliner") and [Danny Kopec](Danny_Kopec "Danny Kopec"). All three were involved in producing a taxonomy of concepts for evaluating chess [strength](Playing_Strength "Playing Strength"), resulting from [Advances in Computer Chess 6](Advances_in_Computer_Chess_6 "Advances in Computer Chess 6") conference held in August 1990 <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> .
