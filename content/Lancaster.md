**Lancaster**, (Scott's program, Scott)  

an early chess program for the [ICL 1909/5](index.php?title=ICL_1900&action=edit&redlink=1 "ICL 1900 (page does not exist)") mainframe computer developed in 1968 by the then 17 year-old [John J. Scott](John_J._Scott "John J. Scott"), at that time beside [Atlas](Atlas "Atlas") by [Alex Bell](Alex_Bell "Alex Bell") the only other chess program in England <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. Scott's program used an effective [iterative deepening](Iterative_Deepening "Iterative Deepening") approach <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> and even already [internal iterative deepening](Internal_Iterative_Deepening "Internal Iterative Deepening").


Lancaster played an exhibition match versus [Greenblatt's Chess Program](Mac_Hack "Mac Hack") at the 1968 [IFIP](IFIP "IFIP") [conference](Conferences#IFIP4 "Conferences") held in [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh) <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>. The game was analyzed by [Jack Good](Jack_Good "Jack Good"), as published in [Donald Michie's](Donald_Michie "Donald Michie") *Machine Intelligence 4* <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>. Scott's program was further sparring partner of Atlas, the forerunner of [Master](Master "Master").

```C++
Greenblatt's program was exhibited at the 1968 IFIPS held in Edinburgh. It was a major attraction, drawing large crowds who cheered the program on to a win against the majority of its opponents. A special match was arranged between the program and one written by John Scott for the ICL 1909/5. An analysis of this game was made by I. J. Good, with the comment that Scott's program had a chance to draw at the 58th move, but made a bad move and then resigned. Because it was generally agreed that Greenblatt's program was the best to that date, Scott's program had done well to last so long. Both these programs were powerful opening and middle game players but became, from recorded games, relatively weak should they reach an end game. It seemed to the author that if it were possible to play a vigorous swapping strategy in order to reach an end game quickly then, even with a queen advantage, neither program would be actually able to realise the mate.

## The Game


The first four moves on each side were played before the machines took over the play, because Lancaster could not [castle](Castling "Castling"). The move time limits originally agreed were 90 seconds for Lancaster and 'blitz speed' (5 or 10 seconds per move) for the Greenblatt program, as it was considered that the [PDP-10](PDP-10 "PDP-10") is about 10 times faster than the ICL 1909/5. After a few moves the PDP-10 team increased its move time limit to about 25 seconds per move, while Lancaster remained at 90 <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a>.
