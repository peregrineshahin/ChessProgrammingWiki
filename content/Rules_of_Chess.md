**Rules of Chess**, (Laws of Chess)   

the basic rules about the nature and objectives of the game of chess along with rules concerning a competition of chess playing entities (human, computer, teams),
such as equipment used, [time control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_control), conduct and ethics of players or operators of chess engines, accommodations for physically challenged players, [adjournment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjournment_(games)) and [adjudication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#A) rules, and recording of moves using [chess notation](Game_Notation "Game Notation") [[1]](#cite-note-wikipedia-1). 



## Competition Rules


The standard rules of [over the board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#over_the_board) (OTB) chess
between humans, and in parts, humans and computers <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, 
are set by [FIDE](FIDE "FIDE") with possible modifications by some national organizations and affiliates, in particular concerning [fast chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess) and [Chess960](Chess960 "Chess960"). 
[Correspondence chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess) rules are set by the [ICCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Correspondence_Chess_Federation).
The [ICGA](ICGA "ICGA") applies their [ICGA Tournament Rules](ICGA_Tournament_Rules "ICGA Tournament Rules") for computer chess events they organize, in particular the [World Computer Chess Championship](World_Computer_Chess_Championship "World Computer Chess Championship") and [World Chess Software Championship](World_Chess_Software_Championship "World Chess Software Championship"), so far played OTB.
Online computer chess tournaments such as former [CCT](CCT_Tournaments "CCT Tournaments") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> and [TCEC](TCEC "TCEC") define their own rule sets <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>.



## Computer Assistance


While computer assistance is encouraged in [advanced chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_chess) and in particular freestyle chess 
and de facto standard in [correspondence chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess) <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>, 
it is considered [cheating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_chess) in human [online chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_chess) or standard chess tournaments and matches with standard time control.
