**Charles F. Wilkes**,

an American chess programmer and [IBM](index.php?title=IBM&action=edit&redlink=1 "IBM (page does not exist)") employee, along with his son [Charlie Wilkes](Charlie_Wilkes "Charlie Wilkes") author of the chess program [The Fox](The_Fox "The Fox").
Inspired by the [George R. R. Martin](Category:George_R._R._Martin "Category:George R. R. Martin") essay *[The Computer Was A Fish](</CCCP_(US)#TheComputerWasAFish> "CCCP (US)")* in [Analog Science Fiction and Fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_Science_Fiction_and_Fact), August 1972 <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>, concerning the early [ACM Tournaments](ACM_1971 "ACM 1971"),
they soon started to write an own chess program in [APL](index.php?title=APL&action=edit&redlink=1 "APL (page does not exist)"), without knowledge of how others had to that point programmed.
They invented their own equivalent to [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") pruning. The Fox played the 4th [ACM 1973](ACM_1973 "ACM 1973") on an [IBM 370-145](IBM_370 "IBM 370") with a win against [Tech 2](Tech "Tech") in the first round,
but suffered from too many users on their [timesharing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing) on Monday,
where they lost both games due to time forfeit
