**Martin Thoresen**,  

a Norwegian IT consultant and [Microsoft](Microsoft "Microsoft") employee, computer chess aficionado, tester, initiator, [organizer](Category:Tournament_Director "Category:Tournament Director"), director and eponym of the [Thoresen Chess Engine Competition](TCEC "TCEC"), in 2015,
when [Chessdom](index.php?title=Chessdom&action=edit&redlink=1 "Chessdom (page does not exist)") by [Anton Mihailov](Anton_Mihailov "Anton Mihailov") took over the organization, renamed as **Top Chess Engines Competition**.
He got interested in computer chess in 2006 after watching [Magnus Carlsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen) at the [Chess World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_World_Cup_2005) in late 2005, 
and spent some time as part of the [CCRL](CCRL "CCRL") testing group, but thought it would be more interesting to actually watch the games, using long time control - and preferably live - so the idea of TCEC was born, [first season](TCEC_Season_1 "TCEC Season 1") launched in 2010 <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
