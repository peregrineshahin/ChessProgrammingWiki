**Awesome**,

a chess program by [FIDE Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDE_titles#FIDE_Master_.28FM.29)
and former Australian Postal champion [Bill Jordan](Bill_Jordan "Bill Jordan"), first released in April 2001. Awesome stared as [MS-DOS](MS-DOS "MS-DOS") program with an own [GUI](GUI "GUI") and later evolved to an [WinBoard](WinBoard "WinBoard") compliant chess engine to run under [Windows](Windows "Windows"). Awesome played the [NC3 2003](NC3_2003 "NC3 2003"), [NC3 2004](NC3_2004 "NC3 2004"), [NC3 2005](NC3_2005 "NC3 2005") and [NC3 2006](NC3_2006 "NC3 2006") [Australasian National Computer Chess Championships](Australasian_National_Computer_Chess_Championship "Australasian National Computer Chess Championship").

## Description

from the Awesome site by [Bill Jordan](Bill_Jordan "Bill Jordan") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>

```
On and off over the years I have experimented with my chess playing program (Awesome). It is written in [Borland C++](Cpp "Cpp") and was written entirely from scratch with many original approaches.

```

```
Awesome examines only a few [moves](Moves "Moves") compared with most chess engines, but sees quite deeply, thanks to good [move ordering](Move_Ordering "Move Ordering") and other factors. In a one minute [game](Chess_Game "Chess Game"), it is sometimes able to store every position examined in a game, in the [hash table](Transposition_Table "Transposition Table"). It some ways it emulates the way a human player thinks. One of my aims is to make the [search tree](Search_Tree "Search Tree") as small as possible (without losing any effectiveness).
