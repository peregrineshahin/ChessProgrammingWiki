**[Home](Home "Home") * [Evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") * [Pawn Structure](Pawn_Structure "Pawn Structure") * Hidden Passed Pawn**

The **Hidden Passed Pawn** is an evaluation term used in [Crafty](Crafty "Crafty"), in the terminology proposed by [Hans Kmoch](Hans_Kmoch "Hans Kmoch") it is referred to as a [Sneaker](</Candidates_(Bitboards)#Sneaker> "Candidates (Bitboards)") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. It is a [rammed pawn](</Pawn_Rams_(Bitboards)> "Pawn Rams (Bitboards)") already on the opponent side of the board without further [sentries](Sentry "Sentry"), which may become a [passer](Passed_Pawn "Passed Pawn") through a sacrificial combination usually by a [faker](Faker "Faker"), which possibly allows the opponent to establish a passer as well, though at least two ranks less advanced and losing the [pawn race](Pawn_Race "Pawn Race") assuming both [unstoppable](Unstoppable_Passer "Unstoppable Passer").

## Sample

Suppose that white has pawns on a6 and b5, and black on a7. At first glance we have a [backward pawn](Backward_Pawn "Backward Pawn") on b5, which is bad for white. However, after playing b5-b6, white gets a passed pawn either there or on a6. For that reason the pawn on a6 should be termed "a hidden passed pawn" and awarded a bonus if "unstoppable".

[Fakers](Faker "Faker") on b5 and g4 make a6 and h5 Sneakers

## Comparison with Candidates

If we put the sneakers of the above position one rank back so that they become helpers of the now neighbored [candidates](Candidate_Passed_Pawn "Candidate Passed Pawn"), the usual idea is to advance the candidates instead of the helpers. The lonesome [sentry](Sentry "Sentry"), forced to capture, may be recaptured to establish an exclusive passer on the candidate's file. Alternatively instead of the recapture, the helper may advance to become a passer as well, which yields to a [transposition](Transposition "Transposition") of the hidden passed pawn idea. This may be stronger if the pawn becomes an [unstoppable passer](Unstoppable_Passer "Unstoppable Passer") leaving the opponent king outside its [square](Rule_of_the_Square#TheSquareofthePawn "Rule of the Square"), while the candidate could be caught.
