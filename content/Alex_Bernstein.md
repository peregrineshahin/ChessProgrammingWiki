[](File:AlexBernstein.jpg) Alex Bernstein <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
**Alex Bernstein**, (December 14, 1930 - March 11, 1999 <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>)

was an American mathematician, chess player, and [computer chess pioneer](Category:Pioneer "Category:Pioneer").
While affiliated with [IBM](index.php?title=IBM&action=edit&redlink=1 "IBM (page does not exist)") in the 50s, along with his colleagues [Michael de V. Roberts](Michael_de_V._Roberts "Michael de V. Roberts"), [Timothy Arbuckle](Timothy_Arbuckle "Timothy Arbuckle") and [Martin Belsky](Martin_Belsky "Martin Belsky"),
he was primary author of [The Bernstein Chess Program](The_Bernstein_Chess_Program "The Bernstein Chess Program") for the [IBM 704](IBM_704 "IBM 704"), which was the first complete chess program in history.

Alex Bernstein was born in [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan) <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> as son of Russian born, Italian mathematician [Vladimir Bernstein](Mathematician#VBernstein "Mathematician") (1900 - 1936) <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>
<a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>.
In 1940, Vladimir’s mother Elizabeth and her second husband fled from [Fascist Italy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_Italy_(1922%E2%80%931943)>), bringing Alex and his sister to [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City).
Alex Bernstein started playing chess seriously during his high school time at [City College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York). After graduating from [Columbia University](Columbia_University "Columbia University"),
he served at the [US army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army), where he became acquainted with [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer).
As full-time employee at [IBM](index.php?title=IBM&action=edit&redlink=1 "IBM (page does not exist)"), he got interested in writing a chess program, and talked with [Claude Shannon](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon") about his ideas.
During the 1956 [Dartmouth workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop), when he was invited to talk about his program already in development,
a discussion with [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy") led to McCarthy's discovery of [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") - according to McCarthy, Bernstein was not initially convinced about the idea <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>.
[Pamela McCorduck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_McCorduck), who was married to [Joseph F. Traub](Mathematician#JFTraub "Mathematician")
gives details in her seminal book *[Machines Who Think](Artificial_Intelligence#MachinesWhoThink "Artificial Intelligence")* <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a>,
with some quotes below, including from an interview with Alex Bernstein.

Alex Bernstein, pp. 180:

```
I started playing chess seriously, I guess, when I was in high school. I played chess so much that it affected my grades in college. One year I played chess to the exclusion of everything else and woke up at the end of the term and discovered I had failed two courses. I was going to [City College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York) at the time. I failed a [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) course and a [math](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) course — theory of [functions of real variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_of_a_real_variable). It was quite a shock and I gave up chess after that term. I suppose I continued reading about it, but I stopped playing chess. Then in graduate school, although I’d given up math for [medieval literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_literature) and [poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_poetry), I worked as an assistant in the [civil engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineering) department. After that I went into the [army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army), and because of my work at [Columbia](Columbia_University "Columbia University") and what I was doing in the army — working in a special research and development outfit of the [Signal Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Corps_(United_States_Army)), I became acquainted with [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) and what they could do.

```

Pamela McCorduck, pp. 181:

```
After Bernstein got out of the army he returned to Columbia, but the academic atmosphere got him down, and when the opportunity came to work full-time for [IBM](index.php?title=IBM&action=edit&redlink=1 "IBM (page does not exist)") he took it. He had been working part time for them, and had become friendly with a young man named Hal Judd <a id="cite-note-9" href="#cite-ref-9">[9]</a>. Judd knew Bernstein had played serious chess, and one day suggested they try to produce a chess-playing program.

```

Alex Bernstein, pp. 181, 182:

```
Nevertheless, the idea of a chess-playing program really intrigued me, so I decided to see if I could come up with a scheme for producing this program and forgetting some backing. It wasn’t impossible to work on this problem oneself, but one did need computer time and computer time is very expensive, although at the time there was a good deal of unused computer time during the third shift. Nevertheless, we had to have some permission at least to do it. So we went to Charlie DeCarlo <a id="cite-note-10" href="#cite-ref-10">[10]</a>, who was head of the so-called Applied Science Division at IBM. DeCarlo is a mathematician and came out of [Carnegie](Carnegie_Mellon_University "Carnegie Mellon University"), and he was very sympathetic to the idea, and said he’d support it on a limited basis. Thus I went to work full-time for IBM at what was then the Scientific Center, and later became part of the Service Bureau, in [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan). I was given other work to do, but essentially it was understood that half of my time I would be allowed to spend working on the chess program.

```

Pamela McCorduck, pp. 183:

```
At this time, Bernstein was unaware of [Shannon’s](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon") seminal papers, and did not know that chess had caught the interests of a group at [Los Alamos](Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory "Los Alamos National Laboratory"), including [J. Kister](James_Kister "James Kister"), [P. Stein](Paul_Stein "Paul Stein"), [S. Ulam](Stanislaw_Ulam "Stanislaw Ulam"), [W. Walden](William_Walden "William Walden"), and [M. Wells](Mark_Wells "Mark Wells"), who were working on a limited 6 x 6 board, rather than the regulation 8 x 8. Nor did he know that [Allen Newell](Allen_Newell "Allen Newell"), [J. C. Shaw](Cliff_Shaw "Cliff Shaw"), and [Herbert Simon](Herbert_Simon "Herbert Simon") together, and [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy") independently, were also pondering chess-playing machines.

```

Pamela McCorduck, Alex Bernstein, pp. 183, 184:

```
It was now that Bernstein became aware of [Turing’s](Alan_Turing "Alan Turing") work and read at least one of [Shannon’s](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon") papers. When he finally began to see how he might codify some of the principles he felt were essential, he telephoned Claude Shannon at [MIT](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"). “I went up to MIT and spent a day or two with him, telling him what I was planning to do, and he said he thought it was intelligent, and a good way of proceeding. Essentially I felt I’d received his blessings, which was pleasant.”

```

Pamela McCorduck, pp. 113:

```
In addition, others came to [Dartmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop) for short visits to talk about related work, and among those visitors was Alex Bernstein, then a programmer for [IBM](index.php?title=IBM&action=edit&redlink=1 "IBM (page does not exist)") in New York City, who was invited to talk about the [chess-playing program](The_Bernstein_Chess_Program "The Bernstein Chess Program") he was working on. His work was known to [Shannon](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon"), [Rochester](Nathaniel_Rochester "Nathaniel Rochester"), and [Arthur Samuel](Arthur_Samuel "Arthur Samuel"), who himself was working on what was to be one of the earliest and most successful of the game-playing programs with computers, one that played [checkers](Checkers "Checkers").

```

Pamela McCorduck, pp. 116:

```
Alex Bernstein, who had come up to Dartmouth from New York to talk about the chess-playing program he already had under way, remembers hearing McCarthy’s plans to begin on a chess-playing program, and listening with interest to his ideas. But when they came to play a game of chess with each other, the equivalent of [mano a mano](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mano_a_mano) in the world of science, Bernstein won, despite the fact that he’d accepted the handicap of [playing blindfold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindfold_chess).

```

## John McCarthy

[John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy") in *The Dartmouth Workshop--as planned and as it happened* <a id="cite-note-11" href="#cite-ref-11">[11]</a>

```
Alex Bernstein of IBM presented his chess program under construction. My reaction was to invent and recommend to him [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") pruning. He was unconvinced.

```

[Quote](Template:Quote_McCarthy_on_Alpha-Beta "Template:Quote McCarthy on Alpha-Beta") by [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy") from *Human-Level AI is harder than it seemed in [1955](Timeline#1955 "Timeline")* on the [Dartmouth workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop):

```
Chess programs catch some of the human chess playing abilities but rely on the limited [effective branching](Branching_Factor "Branching Factor") of the chess move [tree](Search_Tree "Search Tree"). The ideas that work for chess are inadequate for [go](Go "Go"). [Alpha-beta pruning](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") characterizes human play, but it wasn't noticed by [early chess programmers](Category:Pioneer "Category:Pioneer") - [Turing](Alan_Turing "Alan Turing"), [Shannon](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon"), [Pasta](John_Pasta "John Pasta") and [Ulam](Stanislaw_Ulam "Stanislaw Ulam"), and Bernstein. We humans are not very good at identifying the heuristics we ourselves use. Approximations to alpha-beta used by [Samuel](Arthur_Samuel "Arthur Samuel"), [Newell](Allen_Newell "Allen Newell") and [Simon](Herbert_Simon "Herbert Simon"), McCarthy. Proved equivalent to [minimax](Minimax "Minimax") by [Hart](Timothy_Hart "Timothy Hart") and [Levin](Michael_Levin "Michael Levin"), independently by [Brudno](Alexander_Brudno "Alexander Brudno"). [Knuth](Donald_Knuth "Donald Knuth") gives details.

5\. <a id="cite-ref-5" href="#cite-note-5">[5]</a> Quote from [Laurent Mazliak](Mathematician#LMazliak "Mathematician"), Thomas Perfettini (**2019**). *[Under the protection of alien wings. Mathematicians in the Russian emigration in inter war France](https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-02280296v1)*. hal-02280296v2:

Finally, the trajectory of [Vladimir Bernstein](Mathematician#VBernstein "Mathematician") (1900 - 1936) constitutes another singular case,
described in detail in [Finzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Finzi) (1936).
Born in 1900 in [Saint Petersburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg), Bernstein entered the [local university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_State_University) when he was 17 to specialize in mathematics and became close to [Yakov Viktorovich Uspensky](Mathematician#JVUspensky "Mathematician") (1883 - 1947).
Taking advantage of the proximity of the border, he decided to emigrate during the winter of 1919 by reaching [Vyborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyborg) on the other side of the [Gulf of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Finland). Unfortunately, he was seriously wounded by bullet before arriving there, and he never fully recovered from this injury that led to his premature death in 1936.
Arrived in France in the mid-1920s after a stay in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), he entered the [Sorbonne](University_of_Paris "University of Paris") and in 1930 defended a Ph.D. on the singularities of [Dirichlet series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_series), dedicated to ‘his master [Paul Montel](Mathematician#PMontel "Mathematician")’.
The lectures that Vladimir Bernstein presented at the [Collège de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coll%C3%A8ge_de_France) that same year on Dirichlet series were published in 1933 in the [Borel](Mathematician#Borel "Mathematician") series of monographs on the theory of functions as Bernstein (1933).
The book was introduced by a very laudatory preface by [Hadamard](Mathematician#JSHadamard "Mathematician"). It was in Italy, however, that Bernstein decided to settle down (he had already published several papers in Italian journals).
He obtained Italian citizenship in 1931 and was responsible for teaching superior [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis) in [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan) and [analytical geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry) in [Pavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pavia).
