Despite it was an open hardware tournament, it was except the [first edition](USOCCC_1985 "USOCCC 1985"), where [Belle](Belle "Belle") and [Bebe](Bebe "Bebe") competed, a commercial micro computer chess tournament. The tournament was structured in such a way that manufacturers had to play their own machines against each other in some rounds. The rules clearly stated that the operators of each computer had the right to resign or offer a draw on behalf of their machines. Apparently the temptation to take advantage of the rules was too much for [Fidelity](Fidelity_Electronics "Fidelity Electronics") to overcome <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>.
