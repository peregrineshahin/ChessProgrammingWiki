**Chess-64**, (Chess64)\</br/>
a private chess engine by [Fabien Letouzey](Fabien_Letouzey "Fabien Letouzey"), supported and introduced by [Ryan Benitez](Ryan_Benitez "Ryan Benitez") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>. Chess-64 is a [bitboard](Bitboards "Bitboards") engine, not related to the bitboard port of [Fruit](Fruit "Fruit") by Ryan Benitez <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. In Chess-64, Fabien did the bitboards, in Fruit, Ryan. They have little in common in they way they are used in the two programs <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>, for instance Chess-64 already used the [Blockers and Beyond](Blockers_and_Beyond "Blockers and Beyond") method to determine [sliding piece attacks](Sliding_Piece_Attacks "Sliding Piece Attacks") as well as none sliding piece attacks, eventually published in March 2014 in Fabien's new open source engine [Senpai](Senpai "Senpai") <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>. Chess-64 was already registered at [CCT10](CCT10 "CCT10") <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>, but withdrew <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>. A public release of Chess-64 was neither officially announced nor realized.
