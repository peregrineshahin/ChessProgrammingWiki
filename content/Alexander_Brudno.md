\[ Alexander Brudno <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
**Alexander L'vovich Brudno**, (Александр Львович Брудно, January 10, 1918 – December 1, 2009)

was a Russian Jewish mathematician, computer scientist and computer chess pioneer. He received his Ph.D. on [Real functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-valued_function) at [Moscow State University](Moscow_State_University "Moscow State University") under advisor [Dmitrii Menshov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitrii_Menshov) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. Brudno independently discovered the [alpha-beta algorithm](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta"), published [1963](Timeline#1963 "Timeline") in *Problemy Kibernetiki* <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> . The algorithm was implemented inside the [ITEP Chess Program](ITEP_Chess_Program "ITEP Chess Program"), which was written by [Georgy Adelson-Velsky](Georgy_Adelson-Velsky "Georgy Adelson-Velsky") and others at [Alexander Kronrod's](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod") laboratory at Moscow’s [Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics](Institute_of_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Physics "Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics") (ITEF or **ITEP**).

Brudno, also at ITEP at that time was a personal and like­minded friend of Kronrod <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>. According to [Monroe Newborn](Monroe_Newborn "Monroe Newborn"), Alexander Brudno led the team that created the chess program [Kaissa](Kaissa "Kaissa") at Moscow’s [Institute of Control Sciences](Institute_of_Control_Sciences "Institute of Control Sciences") <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>. From 1991 until his death he lived in Israel <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>.

## Quotes

## John McCarthy

[Quote](Template:Quote_McCarthy_on_Alpha-Beta "Template:Quote McCarthy on Alpha-Beta") by [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy") from *Human-Level AI is harder than it seemed in [1955](Timeline#1955 "Timeline")* on the [Dartmouth workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop):

```
Chess programs catch some of the human chess playing abilities but rely on the limited [effective branching](Branching_Factor "Branching Factor") of the chess move [tree](Search_Tree "Search Tree"). The ideas that work for chess are inadequate for [go](Go "Go"). [Alpha-beta pruning](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") characterizes human play, but it wasn't noticed by [early chess programmers](Category:Pioneer "Category:Pioneer") - [Turing](Alan_Turing "Alan Turing"), [Shannon](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon"), [Pasta](John_Pasta "John Pasta") and [Ulam](Stanislaw_Ulam "Stanislaw Ulam"), and [Bernstein](Alex_Bernstein "Alex Bernstein"). We humans are not very good at identifying the heuristics we ourselves use. Approximations to alpha-beta used by [Samuel](Arthur_Samuel "Arthur Samuel"), [Newell](Allen_Newell "Allen Newell") and [Simon](Herbert_Simon "Herbert Simon"), McCarthy. Proved equivalent to [minimax](Minimax "Minimax") by [Hart](Timothy_Hart "Timothy Hart") and [Levin](Michael_Levin "Michael Levin"), independently by Brudno. [Knuth](Donald_Knuth "Donald Knuth") gives details.

## Ershov and Shura-Bura

[Quote](Template:Quote_Shura-Bura "Template:Quote Shura-Bura") from *The Early Development of Programming in the USSR* by [Andrey Ershov](Mathematician#Ershov "Mathematician") and [Mikhail R. Shura-Bura](Mikhail_R._Shura-Bura "Mikhail R. Shura-Bura") <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a>

```
At the end of the 1950's a group of Moscow mathematicians began a study of computerized chess. Sixteen years later, the studies would lead to victory in the [first world chess tournament for computer programs](WCCC_1974 "WCCC 1974") held in Stockholm during the 1974 [IFIP](IFIP "IFIP") Congress. An important component of this success was a deep study of the problems of information organization in [computer memory](Memory "Memory") and of various [search heuristics](Search "Search"). [G. M. Adelson-Velsky](Georgy_Adelson-Velsky "Georgy Adelson-Velsky") and [E. M. Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician") invented the [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) ("dichotomic inquiry") and A. L. Brudno, independent of [J. McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy"), discovered the [(α,β)-heuristic](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") for reducing search times on a game tree.

## Landis and Yaglom

[Quote](Template:Remembering_A.S._Kronrod "Template:Remembering A.S. Kronrod") from *Remembering A.S. Kronrod* by [Evgenii Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician") and [Isaak Yaglom](Mathematician#Yaglom "Mathematician") <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a>:

```
Only in 1955 did a real opportunity arise for [A.S. Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod") to work with an electronic computer. It was the [M­2 computer](M-2 "M-2") constructed by [I.S. Bruk](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/Bruk.htm), [M.A. Kartsev](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/kartsev.htm), and [N.Ya. Matyukhin](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/Matyukhin.htm) in the laboratory of the Institute of Energy named after [Krzhizhanovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleb_Krzhizhanovsky) and directed by I.S. Bruk. This laboratory later became the to Institute for Electronic Control Machines. The mathematics/machine interface was developed by A.L. Brudno, a great personal and like­minded friend of A.S. Kronrod.

```

```
When he started with enthusiasm to program the M­2 machine, A.S. Kronrod quickly came to the conclusion that computing is not the main application of computers. The main goal is to teach the computer to think, i.e., what is now called "[artificial intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence")" and in those days "heuristic programming".

```

```
A.S. Kronrod captivated a large group of mathematicians and physicists ([G.M. Adelson ­Velsky](Georgy_Adelson-Velsky "Georgy Adelson-Velsky"), A.L. Brudno, [M.M. Bongard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongard_problem), [E.M. Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician"), [N.N. Konstantinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Konstantinov), and others). Although some of them had arrived at this kind of problems on their own, they unconditionally accepted his leadership. In the room next to the one housing the M­2 machine the work of the new Kronrod seminar started. At the gatherings there were heated discussions on [pattern recognition](Pattern_Recognition "Pattern Recognition") problems (this work was led by M.M. Bongard; versions of his program "Kora" are still functioning), transportation problems (the problem was introduced to the seminar and actively worked on by A.L. Brudno), problems of automata theory, and many other problems.

[Quote](Template:Quote_Donskoy_on_Hashing "Template:Quote Donskoy on Hashing") from [Mikhail Donskoy's](Mikhail_Donskoy "Mikhail Donskoy") *life cycle of a programmer* <a id="cite-note-9" href="#cite-ref-9">[9]</a>:

```
When I was in high school I learned to program on the [M-20](M-20 "M-20") ... In the group of programmers at [Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics](Institute_of_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Physics "Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics"), where computing work was done on [nuclear physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_physics) on the M-20, they came up with [arrays](Array "Array"), [lists](Linked_List "Linked List"), the need for [subroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine) and more. One of my teachers, [Georgy Adelson-Velsky](Georgy_Adelson-Velsky "Georgy Adelson-Velsky") came up with a [hash memory](Hash_Table "Hash Table"). Details can be found in another of my teachers - [Alexander Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod") "Conversations about programming". Even before [Dijkstra's](Mathematician#EWDijkstra "Mathematician") basic principles of [structured programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming) was known, Alexander Brudno published the book "Programming in meaningful notation." There was also created the first chess program ... The [chess program ITEP](ITEP_Chess_Program "ITEP Chess Program"), the predecessor of [Kaissa](Kaissa "Kaissa") fit in memory of M-20, namely in 4096 cells, each of which has a 48-bit ...
