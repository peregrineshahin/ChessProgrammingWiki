**John A. Birmingham**,  

a British computer scientist and programmer from [Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Research_Establishment), near [Harwell, Oxfordshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harwell,_Oxfordshire), in the neighborhood of [Atlas Computer Laboratory](Atlas_Computer_Laboratory "Atlas Computer Laboratory"), [Chilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilton,_Oxfordshire). In the early 70s, John Birmingham became interested in chess programming, inspired by the work of [Peter Kent](Peter_Kent "Peter Kent") from [Atlas](Atlas_Computer_Laboratory "Atlas Computer Laboratory"), who already inproved [Alex Bell's](Alex_Bell "Alex Bell") program, which was written in [Algol](Algol "Algol"). He translated the program, plus all the new improvements, into [PL/l](index.php?title=PL_1&action=edit&redlink=1 "PL 1 (page does not exist)") and also extended the depth of the search. In 1973 [Alex Bell](Alex_Bell "Alex Bell") joined the team to develop the chess playing program **M**inimax **a**lgorithm Te**ster**, short [Master](Master "Master"), which competed the first three [World Computer Chess Championships](World_Computer_Chess_Championship "World Computer Chess Championship") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, from 1975 with Birmingham <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> and Kent as sole authors. Both authors further improved Master, and as scientists, talked about their secrets in tree searching techniques and [Mate at a Glance](Mate_at_a_Glance "Mate at a Glance") during the first two [Advances in Computer Chess](Conferences "Conferences") conferences, [published](John_Birmingham#Publications "John Birmingham") as Proceedings by [Mike Clarke](Mike_Clarke "Mike Clarke"), and reprinted in [David Levy's](David_Levy "David Levy") [Computer Chess Compendium](Computer_Chess_Compendium "Computer Chess Compendium").

[Alex Bell](Alex_Bell "Alex Bell") about John Birmingham <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>:




```C++
This change from centre control to actively hunting the opponent's king was very noticeable. At this point a very energetic programmer from Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment, John Birmingham, became interested. He translated the program, plus all the new improvements, into [PL/l](index.php?title=PL_1&action=edit&redlink=1 "PL 1 (page does not exist)") in about 6 weeks of his spare time and also extended the depth of the search. I would say at this point that England at last had a program comparable to MACHACK and we ambitiously christened it MASTER-Minimax Algorithm teSTER; if nothing else we had the patent on a good name.
