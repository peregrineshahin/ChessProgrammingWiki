**Chao Ma**,

a Chinese computer scientist, game and chess programmer, and Ph.D. student with the [Artificial Intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence") and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) group at [Oregon State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University). He holds a B.Sc. in Computer Sicence, [Tianjin University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin_University), [Tianjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin). His research interests span machine learning, [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining), and [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), in particular search based [natural language understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding).

Concerning game and chess programming, Chao Ma is author of the chess engine [Cmcchess](Cmcchess "Cmcchess"), a parallel [MTD(f)](</MTD(f)> "MTD(f)") searcher developed since 2009, and before, he worked on a serial of [Wuziqi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuziqi) programs called Mcfive. His open source software projects include Cute-MPI-Interface, an interface program to run [Cutechess-cli](Cutechess-cli "Cutechess-cli") on the cluster system with MPI <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>, Viper-Cluster-Perft, a [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) based perft program that starts from the source code of the chess engine Viper <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, and the Senpai Regression project, an experimental project to explore if a linear model with rich features can be trained by the method and data from [Stockfish](Stockfish "Stockfish") [NNUE](NNUE "NNUE").<a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>He hosts a brief introduction into Stockfish NNUE in Chinese and English on GitHub. <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>
