**Stephen Bernard Streater**,  

a British computer scientist and technology entrepreneur. He holds a degree in mathematics from [Trinity College, Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge) in 1987, but his Ph.D. in [artificial intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence") and [pattern recognition](Pattern_Recognition "Pattern Recognition") at [King's College London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_College_London) was interrupted by the chance to start [Eidos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidos_Interactive) in 1990 - which later became famous for games like [Tomb Raider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider) and others - developing the [Full Motion video (FMV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_motion_video) compression techniques on [RISC OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC_OS) platforms. He then sold Eidos to provide the start-up capital for *Forbidden Technologies* <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, which successfully floated in 2000, best known for their internet video platform and [video editing software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing_software) [Forscene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forscene) <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>. Stephen B. Streater's interests in [Go](Go "Go") also manifests in *Forbidden Technologies* sponsoring the *Epsom Go Tournament* <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a> <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a> <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>.

Already in 1989, Stephen B. Streater began to write his chess program [E6P](E6P "E6P") for the [ARM](ARM2 "ARM2") architecture of the [Acorn Archimedes](Acorn_Archimedes "Acorn Archimedes"), to participate at the [1st Computer Olympiad 1989](1st_Computer_Olympiad#Chess "1st Computer Olympiad") in [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London). Due to its author's expertise in optimization, targeting that [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing) platform, E6P was quite fast for that time, though positionally a bit half-cocked, causing some stir at the Olympiad with possible impact on the career of some Dutch programmers <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a> <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a>. As reported by its author a few years later during the [MChess](MChess "MChess") [killer book](MChess#killerbook "MChess") discussion in [rgcc](Computer_Chess_Forums "Computer Chess Forums"), his program, at that time dubbed C\_897d, was ported to a [StrongARM](index.php?title=StrongARM&action=edit&redlink=1 "StrongARM (page does not exist)") processor, reaching 750,000 [nodes per second](Nodes_per_Second "Nodes per Second") <a id="cite-note-9" href="#cite-ref-9">[9]</a>.
