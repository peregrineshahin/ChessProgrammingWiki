**Sun-x**,  

a series of [UNIX](Unix "Unix") [workstations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workstation) and servers by [Sun Microsystems](index.php?title=Sun_Microsystems&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sun Microsystems (page does not exist)") using [Motorola](index.php?title=Motorola&action=edit&redlink=1 "Motorola (page does not exist)") [680x0](68000 "68000") 16/32-bit processors, and since Sun-4, own 32-bit [SPARC](SPARC "SPARC") processors later evolving to the [SPARCstation](SPARCstation "SPARCstation") line.

The **Sun-1**, launched in May 1982, was based on the [Stanford University](Stanford_University "Stanford University") [SUN workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUN_workstation) designed by [Andy Bechtolsheim](Mathematician#ABechtolsheim "Mathematician"). The Sun 68000 board was a powerful single-board computer. It combined a 10 MHz [Motorola](index.php?title=Motorola&action=edit&redlink=1 "Motorola (page does not exist)") [68000](68000 "68000") microprocessor, a Sun designed [memory management unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit) (MMU), 256 KB of zero wait state [memory](Memory "Memory") with parity, up to 32 KB of [EPROM memory](Memory#ROM "Memory"), two [serial ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port), a 16-bit [parallel port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_port) and an [Intel](Intel "Intel") [Multibus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibus) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.

=Sun 2= The second generation **Sun-2** in late 1983 featured a 10 MHz 68010 with a proprietary MMU to be the first Sun to run a full [virtual memory](Memory#Virtual "Memory"). Early Sun-2 models were based on the Multibus, with later models using [VMEbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMEbus), which continued to be used in the successor Sun-3 and Sun-4 families.




## Sun 3


[ Sun-3 [VMEbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMEbus) CPU Board <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>
The **Sun-3**, launched in September 1985, using an [68020](68020 "68020") and own MMU. Sun-3 systems were supported in [SunOS](Unix "Unix") versions 3.0 to 4.1.1\_U1 and also have current support in [NetBSD](Unix "Unix") and [Linux](Linux "Linux"). 




## Sun 4


The **Sun-4** was launched in 1987 using Sun's own [SPARC](SPARC "SPARC") [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing) architecture. Several variations on the Sun-4 architecture were subsequently developed and used in later computer systems produced by Sun and other vendors.
