**EtaBeta**,

a chess engine by [Antonia Jeanrenaud](Antonia_Jeanrenaud "Antonia Jeanrenaud"), competing the [WCCC 2006](WCCC_2006 "WCCC 2006") in Turin.
EtaBeta, written in [Visual Basic](Basic "Basic"), is not a conventional [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") searcher, but uses an own approach to analyse and select a move.
[Alessandro Scotti](Alessandro_Scotti "Alessandro Scotti") on EtaBeta: "This program is the most original I know of, and the only one with the evaluation of a move as written comment on why the move is good or not.
Unfortunately, the search of Etabeta is too shallow compared to more traditional algorithms, and often remains victim of [combinations](Combination "Combination") it realizes too late" <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> .
