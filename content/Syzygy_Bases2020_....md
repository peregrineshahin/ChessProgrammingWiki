[ Syzygy - Three Planets Dance Over [La Silla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Silla_Observatory) [[1]](#cite_note-1)
**Syzygy Bases**, [[2]](#cite_note-2)  

a compact six piece endgame database developed by [Ronald de Man](Ronald_de_Man "Ronald de Man"), published on April 01, 2013. Since August 2018, **seven piece** Syzygy Bases are available after an effort by [Bojun Guo](Bojun_Guo "Bojun Guo") started in March 2018 [[3]](#cite_note-3). The generator is released under the [GNU General Public License Version 2](Free_Software_Foundation#GPL "Free Software Foundation"), the [thread safe](Thread "Thread") probing code is released without restrictions [[4]](#cite_note-4) .



### File Types


Syzygy Bases consist of two sets of files, **WDL** files (extension .rtbw) storing win/draw/loss information considering the [fifty-move rule](Fifty-move_Rule "Fifty-move Rule") for access during [search](Search "Search"), and **DTZ** files (extension .rtbz) with [distance-to-zero](Endgame_Tablebases#DTZ50 "Endgame Tablebases") information for access at the [root](Root "Root"). WDL has full data for two sides but DTZ50 omitted data of one side to save space. Each endgame has a pair of those types.

### Comparision


Syzygy EGTB is significantly smaller than any existent [DTM](Endgame_Tablebases#DTM "Endgame Tablebases") EGTB. It is 7 times as small as Gaviota for 5 men, 8 times as small as Nalimov for 6 men, 8 times as small as Lomonosov for 7 men. However, when all DTM EGTBs have full data of two sides, Syzygy EGTB omits data of one side for DTZ data to save space. [Ronald de Man](Ronald_de_Man "Ronald de Man") estimated if keep them all, the Syzygy's 6 men size may increase 158 GB, become 307 GB in total, double on size, be 4 times as small as Nalimov 6 men.



## Generation


### Up to 6-man


On the first release (Apr 01, 2013) the generator was ready to generate all endgames up to 6 men. It is multithreading and processes completely in RAM. To generate all 6 men, it requires a system with at least 32 GB of RAM and may run in 5 days (the period was measured with a computer 6-core i3930K @ 4.2Ghz, 64 GB).



### 7-man


Ronald de Man wasn't initially interested in the creation of 7-men Syzygy Based [[5]](#cite_note-5) since the generation would require about 1 TB of RAM, too expensive at that time. Generation time would be about 64 x per table, which means around 175 x time total [[6]](#cite_note-6).His original generator could not create them. But in 2018, he supported [Bojun Guo](Bojun_Guo "Bojun Guo") in his 5-month attempt to generated them [[7]](#cite_note-7). His hardware was estimated at over US$ 90K. In August of 2018 their creation was completed [[8]](#cite_note-8)[[9]](#cite_note-9).



### 8-man


After the completion of 7-man, many people start being curious about the feasibleness of building 8-man. Ronald de Man made an estimation that task requires computers with 64 TB RAM and 2000 TB hard disks[[10]](#cite_note-10) (costed about $640K and $40K respectively in 2020 [[11]](#cite_note-11)).



### Checksums


Syzygy endgame files may contain 128-bit checksum keys at the end of those files. It also has its own code for checksums (based on Google's cityhash library).



## Search


### During the Search


During the [search](Search "Search"), with the WDL tables stored on [SSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) [[12]](#cite_note-12) , it is possible to probe the tables at all [depths](Depth "Depth") without much slowdown. They have been tested in Ronald de Man's engine [Sjaak](Sjaak "Sjaak") (playing on [FICS](index.php?title=FICS&action=edit&redlink=1 "FICS (page does not exist)") as TrojanKnight(C)) a couple of months quite successfully, don't probing in [quiescence search](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search").



### At the Root


At the [root](Root "Root"), since pure DTZ50-optimal play (i.e. minimaxing the number of moves to the next [capture](Captures "Captures") or [pawn move](Pawn_Push "Pawn Push") by either side) can be very unnatural, it might be desirable to let the engine search on the winning moves until it becomes clear that insufficient progress is being made and only then switch to DTZ-optimal play (e.g. by detecting [repetitions](Repetitions "Repetitions") and monitoring the [halfmove clock](Halfmove_Clock "Halfmove Clock")) [[13]](#cite_note-13).



## Pros & Cons


### Pros


* Small sizes. It is about 8 times as small as the second-best EGTBs. Having small sizes is the main success key of Syzygy Bases since it is much easier to create, store, provide, download than other EGTBs
* Free and more popular (than other EGTBs) to find on the Internet
* Support [DTZ50](Endgame_Tablebases#DTZ50 "Endgame Tablebases") metric. That metric can help engines to have better results than [DTM](Endgame_Tablebases#DTM "Endgame Tablebases") which is supported widely by other EGTBs


### Cons


* Hard to integrate with chess engines. [Ronald de Man](Ronald_de_Man "Ronald de Man") has not provided probing code as an independent library but as a part of [Stockfish](Stockfish "Stockfish") chess engines. The probe code has integrated too deeply with that chess engine code and it requires a lot of effort to de-integrate, modify and integrate with other chess projects
* Hard to understand and contribute to the project. ETGB itself is a hard topic. Syzygy EGTB has also integrated with many advanced techniques/tricks. It is written in old-style C language. All make it become very hard to understand and/or modify to improve or for other purposes
* [DTZ50](Endgame_Tablebases#DTZ50 "Endgame Tablebases") metric may lead the engines to win in much longer and ugly ways, compared with [DTM](Endgame_Tablebases#DTM "Endgame Tablebases") one


## Data publish


[Ronald de Man](Ronald_de_Man "Ronald de Man") has provided only open source code for generators/probers but not endgame files themselves. Using his tools some people have generated endgames and published them via DVD or online.



### DVD


As of February 2015, all 3-5 and most important 6-men Syzygy Bases are commercially available on 4 [DVDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD) by [ChessBase](ChessBase "ChessBase") as *Endgame Turbo 4* for their products [Deep Fritz 14](Fritz "Fritz"), [Komodo Chess 8](Komodo#8 "Komodo"), [Houdini 4](Houdini "Houdini") or [ChessBase 12/13](ChessBase_(Database) "ChessBase (Database)") [[14]](#cite_note-14) [[15]](#cite_note-15). 



### Free Download


There are some free FTP servers for downloading such as [Bojun Guo](Bojun_Guo "Bojun Guo") and [Lichess](index.php?title=Lichess&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lichess (page does not exist)") servers.



### 3-6 men


The sizes of those men are small enough to download and store on modern computers. Users should download them in full sets (3, 4, 5, 6 men).



### 7 men


All 7 men files' size is over 16.7 TiB, over storages of typical modern computers. They also require a long time to download too. Thus some users choose to download one or a few endgames only, based on their statistics of use in endgames. Bellow is the top 20 of those endgames by their order. The first one, KRPPvKRP, has a significantly higher frequency of use than the others and should be always downloaded:

## Probe Code and Tools


### Stockfish


[Ronald de Man](Ronald_de_Man "Ronald de Man") did not provide the probe code as an independent library. Instead, he published it firstly as an already integrated code for [Stockfish](Stockfish "Stockfish") chess engines. It is c++ code and it has been rewritten, updated several times by [Stockfish](Stockfish "Stockfish") team.



### Fathom


**Fathom** is a stand-alone Syzygy based probing tool and [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) by [Basil Falcinelli](Basil_Falcinelli "Basil Falcinelli"), introduced in November 2015 along with his [Gull 3](Gull "Gull") release [[16]](#cite_note-16) . Unlike the original tbprobe code, Fathom does not necessarily require the callee to provide [move generation](Move_Generation "Move Generation") functionality. The new modifications and extensions to Ronald de Man's original code which can be "redistributed and/or modified without restrictions", are released under the permissive [MIT License](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology#License "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"). The API consists of three functions [[17]](#cite_note-17)Â :



* tb\_init initializes the tablebase
* tb\_probe\_wdl probes the Win-Draw-Loss (WDL) table for a given position
* tb\_probe\_root probes the Distance-To-Zero (DTZ) table for the given position.


[Jon Dart](Jon_Dart "Jon Dart") has a fork of Fathom with some bug fixes and enhancements [[18]](#cite_note-18), also supporting 7-man [[19]](#cite_note-19).



### Pyrrhic


**Pyrrhic** is a cleaned up Fathom by [Andrew Grant](Andrew_Grant "Andrew Grant"), introduced in August 2020 [[20]](#cite_note-20) [[21]](#cite_note-21).



## Elo gain


[Fishtest](Stockfish#Fishtest "Stockfish") team revealed a test with [Stockfish](Stockfish "Stockfish") (SF10dev) at 10+0.1, with all Syzygy WDL files on RAM, testing using none(0), 4, 5, and 6 man TB in a round-robin tournament[[22]](#cite_note-22).

## Quotes


by [Ronald de Man](Ronald_de_Man "Ronald de Man") in a reply to [Guy Haworth](Guy_Haworth "Guy Haworth"), April 06, 2013 [[23]](#cite_note-23)Â :




```C++
I create both WDL and DTZ in one go, so I don't use WDL in the creation of DTZ. The algorithm used is the [grandfather algorithm](Retrograde_Analysis#Algorithm "Retrograde Analysis") with 2 plies per iteration (I think [HGM](Harm_Geert_Muller "Harm Geert Muller") calls this leapfrogging, but I might be wrong). I tried the outcounting method, but it didn't seem to be competitive (and it makes things more complicated). [[24]](#cite_note-24) [[25]](#cite_note-25)
A pure WDL/DTZ pair is not of much use for creating WDL50+/DTZ50+. I create tables in RAM that have all the information necessary for WDL50+ and DTZ50+, then permute them to different indexing schemes and compress. I do test runs on subsets of the data to find good permutations. (The idea to try permutations is from [Jesper Torp Kristensen's](Jesper_Torp_Kristensen "Jesper Torp Kristensen") master thesis.) [[26]](#cite_note-26) [[27]](#cite_note-27) 

```

[Ronald de Man](Ronald_de_Man "Ronald de Man") in a reply to [Nguyen Pham](Pham_Hong_Nguyen "Pham Hong Nguyen"), April 15, 2020 [[28]](#cite_note-28)Â :




```C++
Syzygy WDL is double sided, DTZ is single sided.
So to know whether a 7-piece position is winning, losing or drawn (or cursed), the engine needs to do only a single probe of a 7-piece WDL table. (It may in addition have to do some probes of 6-piece WDL tables if any direct captures are available.)
If the engine needs to know the DTZ value (which is only necessary when a TB root position has been reached), the probing code may have to do a 1-ply search to get to the "right" side of the DTZ table.
For 6-piece TBs, DTZ is 81.9GB when storing only the smaller side of each table. Storing both sides might require perhaps 240GB.

```

[Morgan Houppin](Morgan_Houppin "Morgan Houppin") explained why his chess engine [Stash](Stash "Stash") doesn't have Syzygy probe code, March 25, 2021 [[29]](#cite_note-29)Â :




```C++
Syzygy probing is a hell of a mess, and I don't want to plug two thousand lines of foreign code that I don't understand, nor do I have the motivation to fully understand how Syzygy files are stored, and then write the additional two thousand lines of code to read them for a mere 5 Elo gain at TCEC.

```

## Endgame News


In his 2014 *Chess Endgame News* in [ICGA Journal, Vol. 37, No. 2](ICGA_Journal#37_2 "ICGA Journal") [[30]](#cite_note-30) , [Guy Haworth](Guy_Haworth "Guy Haworth") classified Syzygy Bases as **new** data in **three** ways:



1. 5-valued scale for evaluating positions in the context of the [FIDE](FIDE "FIDE") [50-move rule](Fifty-move_Rule "Fifty-move Rule") (50mr) which constrains the length of phases of play
	1. +2 â¡ unconditional win for the side to move
	2. +1 â¡ âwinâ which can be frustrated by best play and a 50mr draw-claim
	3. \_0 â¡ unconditional draw
	4. -1 â¡ âlossâ saved by a 50mr draw-claim
	5. -2 â¡ unconditional loss
2. depths for â50mr drawâ positions with value Â±1
3. depths in symmetric, information-preserving ply âpâ


and further gives some news about early software bugs and glitches concerning [ChessBase](ChessBase "ChessBase") products, and the importance of [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) to check the EGT integrity.

 1. [â](#cite_ref-1) Itâs a real treat for photographers and astronomers alike: our skies are currently witnessing a phenomenon known as a syzygy â when three [celestial bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object) (or more) nearly align themselves in the sky. When celestial bodies have similar ecliptic [longitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude), this event is also known as a triple near-[conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_%28astronomy%29). Of course, this is just a trick of perspective, but this doesn't make it any less spectacular. In this case, these bodies are three [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet), and the only thing needed to enjoy the show is a clear view of the sky at sunset. Luckily, this is what happened for [ESO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory) [photo ambassador](http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/partnerships/photo-ambassadors/) [Yuri Beletsky](http://www.eso.org/public/images/yuribeletsky/), who had the chance to spot this spectacular view from ESO's [La Silla Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Silla_Observatory) in northern [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile) on Sunday May 26 , 2013. Above the round domes of the [telescopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope), three of the planets in our [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System) â [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter) (top), [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus) (lower left), and [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28planet%29) (lower right) â were revealed aftersunset, engaged in their cosmic dance. An alignment like this happens only once every several years. The last one took place in May 2011, and the next one will not be until October 2015. This celestial triangle was at its best over the last week of May, but you may still be able to catch a glimpse of the three planets as they form ever-changing arrangements during their journey across the sky - source [Three Planets Dance Over La Silla | ESO](http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1322a/), [Syzygy (astronomy) from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_%28astronomy%29)
