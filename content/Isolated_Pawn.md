**Isolated Pawn**,  

a pawn with no pawns of the same color on the neighboring [files](Files "Files"). It is usually evaluated just like a [backward pawn](Backward_Pawn "Backward Pawn"), except the penalty tends to be bigger, as it is more open to attacks. It may be considered even weaker if positioned on the [half-open file](Half-open_File "Half-open File"), as then it is open to attack by enemy rooks. Many programs tend to evaluate an isolated pawn in the [center](Center "Center") as weaker than on the wing, as it can be attacked from more directions <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
