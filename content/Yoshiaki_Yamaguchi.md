## Infinite Connect Four


Abstract of the [Advances in Computer Games 13](Advances_in_Computer_Games_13 "Advances in Computer Games 13") paper <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>:




```
In this paper, we present the newly obtained solution for variants of Connect-Four played on an infinite board. We proved this result by introducing never-losing strategies for both players. The strategies consist of a combination of paving patterns, which are follow-up, follow-in-CUP, and a few others. By employing the strategies, both players can block their opponents to achieve the winning condition. This means that optimal play by both players leads to a draw in these games.

```


```
By rearrangement of the same paving patterns, the solution for a semi-infinite board, where either the height or the width is finite, are also presented. Moreover, it is confirmed that these results are effective under various placement restrictions.
