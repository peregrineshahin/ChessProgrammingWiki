### Bitboards


In their paper *A Chess Composer of Two-Move Mate Problems*, which received the [ICGA Journal Award](ICGA_Journal#JournalAward "ICGA Journal"), Yaakov HaCohen-Kerner and [Fridel Fainshtein](Fridel_Fainshtein "Fridel Fainshtein") describe their model called *Chess Composer*, which utilizes [Bitboard](Bitboards "Bitboards") [move generation](Move_Generation "Move Generation"). [Sliding piece attacks](Sliding_Piece_Attacks "Sliding Piece Attacks") were generated by a hybrid [none rotated approach](Hiding_the_Implementation "Hiding the Implementation") of [rank lookups](First_Rank_Attacks#AttacksOnAllRanks "First Rank Attacks") and the [classical approach](Classical_Approach "Classical Approach") along with some [bit-twiddling](Bit-Twiddling "Bit-Twiddling") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.



### Abstract



```
Computerized [chess composers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_composer) of [mate problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twomover#Types_of_problem) are rare. Moreover, so far they do not produce either impressive or creative new mate problems. In this paper, we describe a model called CHESS COMPOSER. This model uses a 64-bit representation, an ordered version of [Iterative-Deepening](Iterative_Deepening "Iterative Deepening") [Depth-First Search](Depth-First "Depth-First"), and a quality function built with the help of two international masters in [chess-problem composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_problem). The result is applied on 100 known problems. It shows that the quality of 97 problems has been improved. Some of the improvements are rather impressive considering that most of the tested problems were composed by experienced composers. The new, improved problems can be regarded as creative from the viewpoint of experts in chess compositions, because (1) they seem to be better, and (2) they are not too similar to the original problems.
