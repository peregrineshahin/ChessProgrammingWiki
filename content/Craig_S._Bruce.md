## Selected Quotations

by Craig S. Bruce <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>

- Temporary solutions often become permanent problems (1986)
- In 1969 a couple of guys walked around on the moon, but, much more important to the future of humanity, UNIX was invented (1994)
- If you think a 300 MHz 64-bit RISC processor is better than a good old 8-bit 6502, then you just have a lack of imagination (1994)
- The Dark Side of **The Source**: Inline documentation (1994)
- The problem of research is that someone, somewhere, has already done what you are proposing to do. The challenge is to make sure that you don't find out about this other guy's work until after you have graduated (1994)
- Parallel programming is being repeatedly slapped in the face by your faulty assumptions (2010)
