**Lion**, (Lion++)  

a chess engine by primary author [Giancarlo Delli Colli](Giancarlo_Delli_Colli "Giancarlo Delli Colli"), initially written in [Java](Java "Java") and later ported to [C++](Cpp "Cpp") based on the source code of [Fruit](Fruit "Fruit"), but able to run on [multi-processor](Parallel_Search "Parallel Search"). Lion participated at the [CCC 2005](CCC_2005 "CCC 2005") in [Bologna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna) and the [WCCC 2006](WCCC_2006 "WCCC 2006") in [Turin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin). At the WCCC, after five rounds were played and a protest was filed by a participant, [Yngvi Björnsson](Yngvi_Bj%C3%B6rnsson "Yngvi Björnsson") and independently, [Jonathan Schaeffer](Jonathan_Schaeffer "Jonathan Schaeffer") inspected Lion's source code and found it a close derivative of [Fabien Letouzey’s](Fabien_Letouzey "Fabien Letouzey") program Fruit, which would have been acceptable if this had been revealed, credit given, and permission received before entering <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. The Lion authors did not deny, and provided their own [interpretation of rules](WCCC_2006#TheInterpretationOfRules "WCCC 2006") since they had included a file crediting the effort by Fabien Letouzey, albeit invisible for other people <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>. Lion++ 1.5 was disqualified according to rule 2 <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>. The controversial term 'application detail' was later amended by the [ICGA](ICGA "ICGA") and made explicit as 'submission details' as part of [rule 2](ICGA_Tournament_Rules "ICGA Tournament Rules") <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>.
