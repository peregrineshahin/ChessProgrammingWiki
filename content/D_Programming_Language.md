**[Home](Home "Home") * [Programming](Programming "Programming") * [Languages](Languages "Languages") * D-Programming Language**

**D**,

a programming language developed by [Walter Bright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bright) from [Digital Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Mars) <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
<a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
The first stable version was released 2007. Walter Bright designed many other compilers as the first native compiler, the [Zortech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zortech) [C++](Cpp "Cpp") compiler, the [Symantec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symantec) C++ compiler, and the Digital Mars C++ Compiler and many [C](C "C") compilers (as the [Datalight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalight) C compiler).
[Andrej Alexandrescu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Alexandrescu) joined the design and development effort in 2007. D is a distinct language and has redesigned some core C++ features, while also sharing characteristics from [Java](Java "Java"), [Python](Python "Python"), [Ruby](index.php?title=Ruby&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ruby (page does not exist)"), [C#](C_sharp "C sharp"), and [Eiffel](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_(programming_language)>) <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>.
D is in the Top 20 of the [TIOBE index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index) <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a> .

## Design Principles

The design principles have been to write a compiler for a language that:

- is **fast** without any compromise
- has a **clean syntax** free of the [C++](Cpp "Cpp") quirks
- has all **modern concepts** of [interpreted languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language). In fact D has some [Ruby](index.php?title=Ruby&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ruby (page does not exist)") + [Python](Python "Python") elements that make **programming fun**.
- is **easy** to learn for [C](C "C") and C++ programmers

## Native Features

- Easy string handling
- Static and dynamic [arrays](Array "Array") + [hashes](Hash_Table "Hash Table")
- [Overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading), default parameters, varargs
- Direct [C](C "C") access and debugger support
- [Contract programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract)
- Subset of constructs for easy [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
- Nested functions (as Macros)
- Classes and inheritance and Modules/Mixins and templates
- Advanced testing features as contract programming and class invariants
- [Thread](Thread "Thread") and [fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_%28computer_science%29) support (actors in work)
- [Exception handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling)
- Automatic or explicit [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29): use internal GC or [free / malloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc) as you like.
- [Closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29)
- and more...

## Suitable for Chess Programming

D might be a competitive choice for chess programming because:

- The performance / **speed** is comparable to C / C++
- It has **ulong** (8 bytes) and is very data-type rich

Althought it looks like D has advantages over C/C++ in terms if a modern language, two possible problems might be worth to know

- [Bit-twiddling](Bit-Twiddling "Bit-Twiddling") optimizations
- Impact of [Garbage collection](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>) on predictable results
