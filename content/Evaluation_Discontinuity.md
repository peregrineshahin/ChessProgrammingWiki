title: Evaluation Discontinuity

**[Home](Home "Home") * [Evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") * Discontinuity**

**Evaluation discontinuity** occurs when two positions are assessed as markedly different, even though one can be reached from the other by a short sequence of reasonable moves. This usually happens at the transition between different [game phases](Game_Phases "Game Phases"), for example if the program uses a simple boolean switch to decide whether the position should be considered an endgame. This has a detrimental effect on program's [playing strength](Playing_Strength "Playing Strength"), since at the transition points program begins to search for the ways of switching or not switching between game phases, and not for improving its position.
