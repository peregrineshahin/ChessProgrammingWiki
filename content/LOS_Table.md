After a tournament between two engines is over one can deduct the [likelihood of superiority](Match_Statistics#Likelihood_of_superiority "Match Statistics") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> of one engine over the other by consulting the following table. The first column gives the score difference (wins - losses), the next columns give the LOS for a certain number of games. The table was calculated for a draw ratio of 32%.
