A **Double Check** is a [X-ray](X-ray "X-ray") related chess [tactic](Tactics "Tactics") where two pieces deliver check simultaneously, either most often by one direct check in conjunction with a [discovered check](Discovered_Check "Discovered Check"), or in exceptional rare cases by two discovered checks after an [en passant](En_passant "En passant") capture. Only king moves may legal in double check evasion, which is usually considered by a special case [move generator](Move_Generation "Move Generation") even if not strictly [legal](Legal_Move "Legal Move").
