**p4wn**,  

a quite small [open source chess engine](Category:Open_Source "Category:Open Source") by [Douglas Bagnall](Douglas_Bagnall "Douglas Bagnall"), written in [JavaScript](JavaScript "JavaScript"), released under [CC0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons) or [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) terms, and hosted on [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
It runs in [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) and as standalone JavaScript engine (though less usefully there, without any [UI](User_Interface "User Interface")). 
The first version was released in 2002 as an entry in a 5k web page competition, and its source code was incomprehensibly succinct. 
It used a sort of [principal variation search](Principal_Variation_Search "Principal Variation Search") and a [piece-square table](Piece-Square_Tables "Piece-Square Tables") [oracle](Oracle "Oracle"). 
In 2012 it was rewritten for clarity and for performance in modern JavaScript engines. It now uses a plain [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") search and more sophisticated piece-square tables. 
p4wn plays by all the rules, though it never claims a [draw](Draw "Draw"), just makes the offer and tries to avoid draws if it thinks it is winning. It likes to make rash [sacrifices](Sacrifice "Sacrifice") when ahead.
