**Gideon**,

a [Rebel](Rebel "Rebel") based series of chess programs developed by [Ed Schröder](Ed_Schroder "Ed Schroder") and marketed by [TASC](TASC "TASC") and [Hegener & Glaser](Hegener_%26_Glaser "Hegener & Glaser") in conjunction with plug-in cards as well as [dedicated chess computer](Dedicated_Chess_Computers "Dedicated Chess Computers") [modules](Module "Module") based on [ARM2](ARM2 "ARM2") [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing) processors. The native [PC](IBM_PC "IBM PC") program **Mephisto Gideon** was developed in cooperation with [Hegener & Glaser](Hegener_%26_Glaser "Hegener & Glaser"), and later marketed by [Ossi Weiner](Ossi_Weiner "Ossi Weiner") and various other companies and dealer.

The World Microcomputer Champion and World Champion titles from [1991](WMCCC_1991 "WMCCC 1991") and [1992](WCCC_1992 "WCCC 1992") look a bit ambiguous, since they are not only dedicated to Gideon or the 1992 entry [ChessMachine](ChessMachine "ChessMachine") (with a Gideon program), advertised by [TASC](TASC "TASC") for the ChessMachine and [Hegener & Glaser](Hegener_%26_Glaser "Hegener & Glaser") for the [Mephisto RISC](Mephisto_RISC "Mephisto RISC") modules, but from Ed's perspective also to Rebel itself <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> .

## RISC

Gideon was the name of the first [ARM2](ARM2 "ARM2") [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing) version of Rebel, running on a [TASC](TASC "TASC") [ISA card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISA_bus) for an [IBM PC](IBM_PC "IBM PC"). It became third at the [WMCCC 1990](WMCCC_1990 "WMCCC 1990") in [Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon), and World Microcomputer Champion at the [WMCCC 1991](WMCCC_1991 "WMCCC 1991") in [Vancouver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver) <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> . The further improved Gideon 3.1/32 MHz [ChessMachine](ChessMachine "ChessMachine") became World Champion at the [WCCC 1992](WCCC_1992 "WCCC 1992") in [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid). RISC Gideon was further marketed as PC plug-in [ChessMachine](ChessMachine "ChessMachine") by [TASC](TASC "TASC") in bundle with [The King](The_King "The King") program by [Johan de Koning](Johan_de_Koning "Johan de Koning") <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a> , and as [dedicated chess computer](Dedicated_Chess_Computers "Dedicated Chess Computers") of the [Mephisto RISC](Mephisto_RISC "Mephisto RISC") series by [Hegener & Glaser](Hegener_%26_Glaser "Hegener & Glaser") <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a> <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a> .

## Description

from [Don Beal's](Don_Beal "Don Beal") [WMCCC 1991](WMCCC_1991 "WMCCC 1991") report <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a>:

```C++
Written by Ed Schröder (programmer) and [Jan Louwman](Jan_Louwman "Jan Louwman") (a strong chess-player and designer of the [opening book](Opening_Book "Opening Book")), both previously known over many years for their [Rebel](Rebel "Rebel") program that run on [6502](6502 "6502") pocessors, Gideon is a new program for the ARM-2 RISC CPU and has taken 1.5 years (4000 man-hours) to develop. The evaluation function is complex, incorporating much chess knowledge, and positional scores can range up 1.5 times a Pawn. Gideon includes specialized knowledge for many types of endgame (defined to be when material < 26) such as rook-and-pawn endings. The search techniques include [iterative deepening](Iterative_Deepening "Iterative Deepening"), [check extensions](Check_Extensions "Check Extensions") and [singular extensions](Singular_Extensions "Singular Extensions"). [Moves](Moves "Moves") are [generated](Move_Generation "Move Generation") one-at-a-time, rather than all-and-sort.

## Mephisto Gideon

The [PC](IBM_PC "IBM PC") program **Mephisto Gideon** was developed in cooperation with [Hegener & Glaser](Hegener_%26_Glaser "Hegener & Glaser") and was Ed's first program running under the [MS-DOS](MS-DOS "MS-DOS") operating system, also bundled as **Mephisto Advantage** with the [Saitek PC Auto Chessboard](Saitek_PC_Auto_Chessboard "Saitek PC Auto Chessboard"). It was entirely written in [C](C "C") and marketed by [Ossi Weiner](Ossi_Weiner "Ossi Weiner") and other dealer in large quantities <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a>, while independently **Schröder BV** kept their own brand name Rebel selling it via their own distribution channels in smaller quantities <a id="cite-note-9" href="#cite-ref-9">[9]</a>. In 2012, Ed Schröder resurrected *Mephisto Gideon Professional* as [WinBoard](WinBoard "WinBoard") and [UCI](UCI "UCI") compatible [donationware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donationware) <a id="cite-note-10" href="#cite-ref-10">[10]</a> <a id="cite-note-11" href="#cite-ref-11">[11]</a>.
