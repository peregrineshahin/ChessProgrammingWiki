**Knightmate**,  

a chess variant, in which the royal piece, which is to be [checkmated](Checkmate "Checkmate"), moves like a [knight](Knight "Knight"), whereas knights are replaced by non-royal kings (commoners) are placed on the board instead of knights. The value of a commoner is about 2.2 pawns.
