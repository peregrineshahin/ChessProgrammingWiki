Quote from *Remembering A.S. Kronrod* by [Evgenii Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician") and [Isaak Yaglom](Mathematician#Yaglom "Mathematician") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>:




```C++
Only in 1955 did a real opportunity arise for [A.S. Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod") to work with an electronic computer. It was the [M­2 computer](M-2 "M-2") constructed by [I.S. Bruk](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/Bruk.htm), [M.A. Kartsev](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/kartsev.htm), and [N.Ya. Matyukhin](http://www.computer-museum.ru/english/galglory_en/Matyukhin.htm) in the laboratory of the Institute of Energy named after [Krzhizhanovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleb_Krzhizhanovsky) and directed by I.S. Bruk. This laboratory later became the to Institute for Electronic Control Machines. The mathematics/machine interface was developed by [A.L. Brudno](Alexander_Brudno "Alexander Brudno"), a great personal and like­minded friend of A.S. Kronrod.

```C++
When he started with enthusiasm to program the M­2 machine, A.S. Kronrod quickly came to the conclusion that computing is not the main application of computers. The main goal is to teach the computer to think, i.e., what is now called "[artificial intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence")" and in those days "heuristic programming".

 A.S. Kronrod captivated a large group of mathematicians and physicists ([G.M. Adelson ­Velsky](Georgy_Adelson-Velsky "Georgy Adelson-Velsky"), A.L. Brudno, [M.M. Bongard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongard_problem), [E.M. Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician"), [N.N. Konstantinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Konstantinov), and others). Although some of them had arrived at this kind of problems on their own, they unconditionally accepted his leadership. In the room next to the one housing the M­2 machine the work of the new Kronrod seminar started. At the gatherings there were heated discussions on [pattern recognition](Pattern_Recognition "Pattern Recognition") problems (this work was led by M.M. Bongard; versions of his program "Kora" are still functioning), transportation problems (the problem was introduced to the seminar and actively worked on by A.L. Brudno), problems of automata theory, and many other problems.1. <a id="cite-ref-1" href="#cite-note-1">↑</a> [Evgenii Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician"), [Isaak Yaglom](Mathematician#Yaglom "Mathematician") (**1987**). *Remembering A.S.
