 [](http://hgm.nubati.net/) Shatranj with [WinBoard](WinBoard "WinBoard") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> 
**Shatranj**,  

the Arabic and Persian precurser of [Western Chess](Chess "Chess") and one successor of the ancient [Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent) [strategy game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy_game) [Chaturanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga). Chaturanga developed in the [Gupta Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gupta_Empire) during the [6th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6th_century) [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era) and was adopted as Shatranj in [Sasanian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) in the [7th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_century). In computer chess, due to extensions of the [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol"), [XBoard](XBoard "XBoard") and [WinBoard](WinBoard "WinBoard") support Shatranj with [Elephants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfil_%28chess%29) and General instead of Bishop and Queen <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
