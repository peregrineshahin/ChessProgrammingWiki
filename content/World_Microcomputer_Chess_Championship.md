World Microcomputer Chess Championship, **WMCCC**, organized by the [ICCA](ICCA "ICCA"). The World Microcomputer Chess Championship derived in 1980 from the [PCW Microcomputer Chess Championship](PCW_Microcomputer_Chess_Championship "PCW Microcomputer Chess Championship"). On the triennial meeting of the [ICGA](ICGA "ICGA") during the [WCCC 2002](WCCC_2002 "WCCC 2002"), the members agreed to discontinue the WMCCC on behalf of a yearly [World Computer Chess Championship](World_Computer_Chess_Championship "World Computer Chess Championship") cycle, since the micro distinction seemed no longer contemporary, considering multiprocessors.
