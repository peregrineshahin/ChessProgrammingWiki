**Blikskottel**,

a [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol") compatible chess engine written (in an extremely part-time fashion) in [C](C "C") by [Adam Oellermann](Adam_Oellermann "Adam Oellermann"). Blikskottel is an [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans) slang term (meaning something like *[blighter](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blighter)* or *[rascal](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rascal)*) <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, but Blikskottel's development began in England, and Blikskottel is now resident in Scotland.

## Description

Blikskottel is a simple [bitboard-based](Bitboards "Bitboards") [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") searcher.
The original version was written in [Delphi](Delphi "Delphi"), intended to be an entry into a chess programming competition among a group of programmers.
After the other programmers failed to produce entries, Adam decided to continue anyway. The Delphi version was quickly replaced with C code (originally developed in [Microsoft](Microsoft "Microsoft") [Visual C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B),
but since being ported to [Linux](Linux "Linux") just about anything can compile Blikskottel now); much of this was written while on the train or watching TV, which perhaps accounts somewhat for the engine's lack of performance.
Blikskottel's strength tends to make sudden jumps forward during brief spurts of intense interest in chess programming by the author,
which then fade away as he realises just how awful the codebase is getting to be to work with; then, poor Blikskottel languishes - sometimes for years at a time.
