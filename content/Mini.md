**Mini**,  

a chess program by [Don Dailey](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") and [Larry Kaufman](Larry_Kaufman "Larry Kaufman") which played the [WCCC 1999](WCCC_1999 "WCCC 1999") in [Paderborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paderborn), operated by [Harald Prokop](Harald_Prokop "Harald Prokop"). It was used to even the number of entries, based on the 1993 [C](C "C") program with the internal name Mini, the common ancestor of the [ACM 1993](ACM_1993 "ACM 1993") winner [Titan](Titan "Titan") aka [Socrates II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates_II) (C), the commercial [Socrates 3.0](Socrates "Socrates") ([Assembly](Assembly "Assembly")), and [Kasparov's Gambit](Kasparov%27s_Gambit "Kasparov's Gambit") (C) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. 



## WCCC 1999


The WCCC entry was a quick modification in order to get it working on [Unix](Unix "Unix") without [GUI](GUI "GUI"). Apparently, there were [time control](Time_Management "Time Management") issues since Mini played almost instantly, additionally during the first rounds the [hash table](Transposition_Table "Transposition Table") was set too high, so the disk was [trashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_%28computer_science%29).
