**Ingo Bauer**,  

a German computer chess aficionado, tester, operator and [opening book author](Category:Opening_Book_Author "Category:Opening Book Author"). 
Ingo co-organized the [BELCT 2001](BELCT_2001 "BELCT 2001"), where he also operated [Yace](Yace "Yace"). He is regular tester of [Stefan Meyer-Kahlen's](Stefan_Meyer-Kahlen "Stefan Meyer-Kahlen") [Shredder](Shredder "Shredder"), and was also Shredder operator at various [International Paderborn Computer Chess Championships](IPCCC "IPCCC"). 
However, during the [WCCC 2015](WCCC_2015 "WCCC 2015") and [WCSC 2015](WCSC_2015 "WCSC 2015") in [Leiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden), Ingo Bauer switched sides, and was primary operator of the new [Ginkgo](Ginkgo "Ginkgo") by [Frank Schneider](Frank_Schneider "Frank Schneider"). 
He operated Ginkgo versus later WCSC winner [Shredder](Shredder "Shredder") seven times including the blitz tournament, bravely fighting with the [light pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pen), the WCCC round 3 game and the WCSC round 5 game which were drawn, as well as the two play-off games, 
not until the final blitz play-off was then won by Shredder by the narrowest margin of 1½ - ½. 
For some years, Ingo Bauer maintained the [IPON](IPON "IPON") [rating list](Engine_Rating_Lists "Engine Rating Lists").
