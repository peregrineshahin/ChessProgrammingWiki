**[Home](Home "Home") \* [Chess](Chess "Chess") \* [Tactics](Tactics "Tactics") \* Overloading**


**Overloading** is a chess tactic where a piece has more than one exclusive defending obligation. For instance, if the defending piece is member of two or more balanced [defend and attack sets](Attack_and_Defend_Maps "Attack and Defend Maps") (equal number of attacks and defends) of their respective critical squares, the piece is likely overloaded, except for defending [sliding pieces](Sliding_Pieces "Sliding Pieces") with both squares connected by a single move. Critical squares, attacked by the opponent, are either occupied by pieces from the defenders side, and/or otherwise [mate](Checkmate "Checkmate") threatening squares around the king or the backrank.


Despite tactics is the domain of [search](Search "Search"), and static [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") of overloading pieces seems complicated considering tactical interactions and issues like pieces [en prise](En_prise "En prise") or [hanging](Hanging_Piece "Hanging Piece"), [discovered attacks](Discovered_Attack "Discovered Attack"), [checks](Check "Check"), [pins](Pin "Pin"), [Zwischenzug](Zwischenzug "Zwischenzug") and counter attacks, some programs statically determine overloading pieces and other tactical motives for counting all kinds of obligations to consider their balance in nonlinear evaluation terms and/or controlling the [search](Search "Search"), [quiescence search](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search") and their [selectivity](Selectivity "Selectivity").
