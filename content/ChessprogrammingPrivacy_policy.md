By using the Chess Programming Wiki, you are accepting the practices described in this statement.

1. The Chess Programming Wiki collects and retains the least amount of personally identifiable information needed to fulfill the website’s operational needs.

1. Interactions with the Chess Programming Wiki not covered by this policy include, but are not limited to, aspects of browsing and editing pages and use of eventual user messages functions. These interactions may reveal a contributor’s IP address, and possibly other personal information, indiscriminately to others acting independently of the Chess Programming Wiki.
1. Users may also interact with one another outside of the Chess Programming Wiki, via email, IRC or other chat, or independent websites and fora, such as Talkchess, and should assess the risks involved, and their personal need for privacy, before using such offsite methods of communication.
1. Whereas reading is open and free for all, the Chess Programming Wiki requires contributors to apply for a registered account.
1. Editing is not possible if you did not apply for and have been granted an account first.

1. Online, registered users are identified by their username. Users select a password, which is confidential and used to verify the integrity of their account. Except insofar as it may be required by law, no person should disclose, or knowingly expose, either user passwords and/or cookies generated to identify a user. Once created, user accounts will not be removed. Although it is possible for a username to be changed, depending on the circumstances, but the Chess Programming Wiki does not guarantee that a username will be changed on request.
1. All users are personally responsible for safeguarding the secrecy of their personal password; you can alter this private password at any time in your preferences.

1. We have links to external, other websites on the Chess Programming Wiki. If you visit these websites, these in turn may also collect information, and because such sites are not within our control they are not covered by this privacy statement.
1. If we believe that your use of the site is unlawful or damaging to others, we reserve the right to disclose the information we have obtained through the site about you to the extent that it is reasonably necessary in our opinion to prevent, remedy or take action in relation to such conduct.
