A **loose piece** is a [piece](Pieces "Pieces") not defended by own man. Loose pieces and undefended pawns, even if actually not [attacked](Attacks "Attacks") and therefor [en prise](En_prise "En prise"), may be considered in [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation"), specially if there are more than one or even two per side, and the opponent has forces and possibilities for [double attacks](Double_Attack "Double Attack") and [knight forks](Knight_Pattern#KnightForks "Knight Pattern"). [Game phase](Game_Phases "Game Phases"), an exposed [king](King "King") and the presence of the opponent queen can be considered as well in that evaluation term.
