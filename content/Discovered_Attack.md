A **Discovered Attack** is a [X-ray](X-ray "X-ray") related chess tactic, revealed when one piece moves out of the way of a [sliding piece](Sliding_Pieces "Sliding Pieces") [ray](Rays "Rays"), discovering an [attack](Attacks "Attacks") to [squares](Squares "Squares"), opponent pieces or the [king](King "King"), the latter case called a [Discovered Check](Discovered_Check "Discovered Check"). Discovered attacks can be extremely powerful, as the piece moved can make a threat independently of the piece it reveals.

During [move generation](Move_Generation "Move Generation") or [move ordering](Move_Ordering "Move Ordering"), one may encourage discovering moves by considering [origin squares](Origin_Square "Origin Square") attacked by an own sliding pieces, as well as the resulting attacking [direction](Direction "Direction").
