**Arthur**,

a [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol") compatible, portable chess engine by [Walter Ravenek](Walter_Ravenek "Walter Ravenek"). Developed in the 90s, Arthur had an own [graphical user interface](GUI "GUI") for the [Apple](index.php?title=Apple&action=edit&redlink=1 "Apple (page does not exist)") [Macintosh](Macintosh "Macintosh") computer.

## Tournament Play

Arthur played various [Dutch Open Computer Chess Championships](Dutch_Open_Computer_Chess_Championship "Dutch Open Computer Chess Championship") with strong results, for instance becoming third at the [DOCCC 1998](DOCCC_1998 "DOCCC 1998") behind [The King](The_King "The King") and [CilkChess](CilkChess "CilkChess"). It further played multiple [Aegon Tournaments](Aegon_Tournaments "Aegon Tournaments") in the 90s, the [IPCCC 1994](IPCCC_1994 "IPCCC 1994"), the [WMCCC 1997](WMCCC_1997 "WMCCC 1997") in [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris) and the [WCCC 1999](WCCC_1999 "WCCC 1999") in [Paderborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paderborn).

## Descriptions

from the [ICGA](ICGA "ICGA") tournament site <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>

## 1997

```C++
Arthur is an amateur chess program that has been developed as a literate program, i.e., with description and source code integrated in a single document. The complete print-out is some 500 pages. The program uses conventional [search](Search "Search") techniques, with some specific [extensions](Extensions "Extensions") developed by the author. The program is knowledge intensive and plays mainly positional games. Arthur has been a regular guest in the AEGON Man vs. Machine tournaments and the Open Dutch Computer Chess Championships. Over the last three years it has finished between the top amateur programs. 

```

## 1999

```C++
Arthur is a strong Dutch amateur program. It has finished as the best amateur program in the [Open Dutch Computer Chess Championships](Dutch_Open_Computer_Chess_Championship "Dutch Open Computer Chess Championship") for the last three years, performing reasonably well against commercial programs. The program consists of a platform independent chess engine, which is connected to a [graphical user interface](GUI "GUI") for the [Macintosh](Macintosh "Macintosh"). A [WinBoard](WinBoard "WinBoard") version will be available in the near future. Arthur is quite capable tactically, but it tends to play a positional game, when given the chance. 

```

## Computer Judgment

In 1995, Walter Ravenek mentioned that Arthur has code to handle the position composed by [Roger Penrose](Mathematician#RPenrose "Mathematician") concerning [blockage detection](Blockage_Detection "Blockage Detection"). Does your program avoid bxa5? Walter found it a nice challenge, but due to little practical value, the code was deactivated to safe some evaluation time <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>:
