The **Target Square** of a [move](Moves "Moves"), also called to- or destination square, is the square occupied by the moving [piece](Pieces "Pieces") after [making the move](Make_Move "Make Move"). If the target square was occupied by an opponent piece in case of a [capture](Captures "Captures"), the opponent piece is removed from the board as part of the completion of the move. In [piece wise](Pieces_versus_Directions#PieceByPiece "Pieces versus Directions") [move generation](Move_Generation "Move Generation"), [move origins](Origin_Square "Origin Square") are subject of an outer loop over all pieces, while the target squares are subject of an inner loop, after attack and move target generation. [Direction-wise](Pieces_versus_Directions#DirectionWise "Pieces versus Directions") move generation traverses target squares per direction and generally requires more effort to determine the from-squares.
