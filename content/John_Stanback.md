**John Stanback**,  

an American electrical engineer and computer chess programmer. He started chess programming in about 1978 with [Basic](Basic "Basic") and [Fortran](Fortran "Fortran"), until he switched to [Pascal](Pascal "Pascal") and in 1986 to [C](C "C"). His early program [SCP](SCP "SCP") (Stanback Chess Program), was already published in 1987 as [open source](Category:Open_Source "Category:Open Source") in [comp.sources.games](Computer_Chess_Forums "Computer Chess Forums") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, and later evolved to [GNU Chess](GNU_Chess "GNU Chess"). In 1989 John Stanback did a complete rewrite and called the new program [Zarkov](Zarkov "Zarkov") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>, which was subject of experiments with various ideas until recently. In June 2016, the successor of Zarkov dubbed [Wasp](Wasp "Wasp") was released, announced and hosted by [Frank Quisinsky](Frank_Quisinsky "Frank Quisinsky") <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a> <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>.
