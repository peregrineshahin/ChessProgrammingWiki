The **Type A Strategy** was coined in 1949 by [Claude Shannon](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon") in his groundbreaking publication *Programming a Computer for Playing Chess* <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> as a [brute-force](Brute-Force "Brute-Force") strategy, which Shannon concluded would be both slow and a weak player, due to the [average branching factor](Branching_Factor "Branching Factor") and the huge exponential explosion. He therefor favored to search only a small subset of plausible moves within a [Type B strategy](Type_B_Strategy "Type B Strategy"). However, with the advent of [alpha-beta](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") and all its enhancement, brute-force got very successful from the 70s until present, since the task of classifying and excluding "not plausible" moves, turned out to be quite difficult and error-prone.
