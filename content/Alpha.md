**Alpha** (Î±) is the [lower bound](Lower_Bound "Lower Bound"), representing the minimum [score](Score "Score") that a [node](Node "Node") must reach in order to change the value of a previous node. Alpha has the same semantic as max in [Negamax](Negamax "Negamax"), and represents the minimum score that the maximizing player is assured of assuming optimal play of both sides.
