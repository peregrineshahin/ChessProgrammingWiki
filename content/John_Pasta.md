**John R. Pasta**, (1918 – June 5, 1981)  

was an American computer scientist, known for his participation in the [Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project) and the [Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%E2%80%93Pasta%E2%80%93Ulam%E2%80%93Tsingou_problem). In 1952, at [Los Alamos National Laboratory](Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory "Los Alamos National Laboratory"), working under [Nicholas Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Metropolis) on the [MANIAC I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MANIAC_I), John Pasta aided in the construction of an early computer that specialized in calculations around weapons design. John Pasta was head of the department of Computer Science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign") from 1964 to 1970.

According to [John McCarthy's](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy") [quote](#quote), Pasta is considered as early chess programmer, co-developing the [MANIAC I chess program](MANIAC_I "MANIAC I"). 



## Quote


[Quote](Template:Quote_McCarthy_on_Alpha-Beta "Template:Quote McCarthy on Alpha-Beta") by [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy") from *Human-Level AI is harder than it seemed in [1955](Timeline#1955 "Timeline")* on the [Dartmouth workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop): 




```
Chess programs catch some of the human chess playing abilities but rely on the limited [effective branching](Branching_Factor "Branching Factor") of the chess move [tree](Search_Tree "Search Tree"). The ideas that work for chess are inadequate for [go](Go "Go"). [Alpha-beta pruning](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") characterizes human play, but it wasn't noticed by [early chess programmers](Category:Pioneer "Category:Pioneer") - [Turing](Alan_Turing "Alan Turing"), [Shannon](Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon"), Pasta and [Ulam](Stanislaw_Ulam "Stanislaw Ulam"), and [Bernstein](Alex_Bernstein "Alex Bernstein"). We humans are not very good at identifying the heuristics we ourselves use. Approximations to alpha-beta used by [Samuel](Arthur_Samuel "Arthur Samuel"), [Newell](Allen_Newell "Allen Newell") and [Simon](Herbert_Simon "Herbert Simon"), McCarthy. Proved equivalent to [minimax](Minimax "Minimax") by [Hart](Timothy_Hart "Timothy Hart") and [Levin](Michael_Levin "Michael Levin"), independently by [Brudno](Alexander_Brudno "Alexander Brudno"). [Knuth](Donald_Knuth "Donald Knuth") gives details.
