The **Chessboard** is the playing ground for the [game of chess](Chess_Game "Chess Game") and its up to 16 white and black [pieces](Pieces "Pieces") each. It consists of [64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64_%28number%29) [squares](Squares "Squares"), eight rows, called [ranks](Ranks "Ranks"), times eight columns, called [files](Files "Files"). The squares are alternating dichromatic (light or white, and dark or black squares) on ranks as well on files. Ranks are labeled from '1' to '8', the files from 'A' to 'H' (or with lower case letters 'a' to 'h'), so that each square can be uniquely addressed via concatenated file- and rank labels. The lower left square with the "Address" 'a1' is dark. The [diagonals](Diagonals "Diagonals") are the north-east directed, distinguished from the [anti-diagonals](Anti-Diagonals "Anti-Diagonals") in north-west directions.

Inside a chess program, the chessboard and its piece placement as [chess position](Chess_Position "Chess Position") is subject of the [board representation](Board_Representation "Board Representation").

## Fourfold Symmetry

The chessboard is fourfold [symmetrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry) with respect to rotation about an axis, based on the [reflection symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_symmetry) of a square *(not square of a chessboard but the whole board here)*. The four axis are the vertical line between the two center-files 'D' and 'E', the horizontal line between the 4th and 5th rank, and the main-diagonal and main-anti-diagonal. The orthogonal symmetrical squares have different, the diagonal symmetrical squares have same [square-colors](Color_of_a_Square "Color of a Square").
