**Ruslan Sinulla Ogly Hajiev**,  

an Azerbaijani [psychologist](Category:Psychologist "Category:Psychologist") and computer scientist. In 1975, while affiliated with the Republican Information and Computing Centre, Ministry of Health of the [Azerbaijan SEER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan_Soviet_Socialist_Republic), [Baku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku) <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>, he tried to identify typical [tactical motifs](Tactics "Tactics") by observing the chess master's [eye movement](Eye_Movements "Eye Movements") when searching for a forced [combination](Combination "Combination") in a given [position](Chess_Position "Chess Position") displayed on a large demonstration board. 
Hajiev reported that he was indeed able to derive from experimental data some important tactical relations which he later implemented in a chess-playing program. He gave examples of tactical positions in which his program was able to simulate the master's behavior with striking efficacy <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
