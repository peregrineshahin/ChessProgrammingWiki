**Aristarch**,

a chess engine by [Stefan Zipproth](Stefan_Zipproth "Stefan Zipproth"), compliant to the [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol") as well as the [Universal Chess Interface](UCI "UCI"), running under [Windows](Windows "Windows").
The development of Aristarch already started in 1995 and was first written in [Basic](Basic "Basic"), version 2 was mainly a [C](C "C") port, but version 3 was a complete rewrite in [C++](Cpp "Cpp"),
using a strictly [object oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) design, utilizing [bitboards](Bitboards "Bitboards") to represent the board,
and apparently [rotated bitboards](Rotated_Bitboards "Rotated Bitboards") to generate [sliding piece attacks](Sliding_Piece_Attacks "Sliding Piece Attacks").
Version 4.0 includes several improvements, the most important being a completely new [pawn evaluation](Pawn_Structure "Pawn Structure") routine <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>,
it otherwise has a rather speculative [king safety](King_Safety "King Safety") evaluation.
Beside commonly known search [extensions](Extensions "Extensions") and [reductions](Reductions "Reductions"), Version 4.21 introduced an original [pruning](Pruning "Pruning") method based on 8 simple conditions <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>. Aristarch played the [CCT4](CCT4 "CCT4") and [CCT5](CCT5 "CCT5") [online tournaments](CCT_Tournaments "CCT Tournaments").

## Etymology

The name of the engine has its origin in the [ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece) [astronomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer) and [Mathematician](Mathematician "Mathematician") [Aristarchus of Samos](Mathematician#Aristarch "Mathematician") (310 BCE - ca. 230 BCE) <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>, who presented the first known model of [Heliocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism) that placed the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) at the center of the known [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) with the [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) revolving around it.
He calculated the [sizes of the Sun and Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sizes_and_Distances_%28Aristarchus%29), as well as their distances from the Earth in terms of Earth's radius.
