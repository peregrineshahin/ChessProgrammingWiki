**Michael A. Lieberman**,   

an American physicist, electrical engineer, and professor emeritus at [University of California, Berkeley](University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley"). He received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from the [MIT](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") in 1962 and his Ph.D. degree from MIT in 1966.
He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) at Berkeley in 1966, and his research areas are [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> and [plasma-assisted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_%28physics%29) [materials processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_processing). 
At MIT, Michael Lieberman was member of the "the chess group" headed by [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy"), along with [Alan Kotok](Alan_Kotok "Alan Kotok"), [Elwyn Berlekamp](Elwyn_Berlekamp "Elwyn Berlekamp") (1960), [Charles Niessen](Charles_Niessen "Charles Niessen") and [Robert A. Wagner](Robert_A._Wagner "Robert A. Wagner"). They wrote the chess program for the [IBM 7090](IBM_7090 "IBM 7090") <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>, which later evolved to the [Kotok-McCarthy-Chess Program](Kotok-McCarthy-Program "Kotok-McCarthy-Program"). 






[Quote](Template:Quote_Alan_Kotok "Template:Quote Alan Kotok") from [Alan Kotok's Oral History](Alan_Kotok#Oral_History "Alan Kotok") concering the development of a [chess program](Kotok-McCarthy-Program "Kotok-McCarthy-Program") under [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy") at [MIT](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"):




```
So there were a total of five people. There was the initial four were, besides me, [Charles Niessen](Charles_Niessen "Charles Niessen"), Chuck Niessen, whose these days is some sort of director over at [Lincoln Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Lincoln_Laboratory). And Mike Lieberman, who is on the faculty at [Berkeley](University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley"). And [Elwyn Berlekamp](Elwyn_Berlekamp "Elwyn Berlekamp"), who is also Berkeley faculty, and fairly famous computer game theory person. Elwyn dropped out of this project at some point, and [Bob Wagner](Robert_A._Wagner "Robert A. Wagner"), another so these were all sort of East Campus [Model Railroad Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club) friends - and Bob Wagner is at, I think, [University of North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Central_University) - whatâ€™s in [Raleigh-Durham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Triangle)?
