The **Origin Square** of a [move](Moves "Moves"), also called initial square, source square, from- or departure square, is the square occupied by a [piece](Pieces "Pieces") about to move. The from-square is usually part of the [move code](Encoding_Moves "Encoding Moves"), while it is derived from giving the moving piece and [target square](Target_Square "Target Square") in [Standard Algebraic Notation](Algebraic_Chess_Notation#SAN "Algebraic Chess Notation"), where the origin square is (partly) omitted except to resolve ambiguity. 


In [piece wise](Pieces_versus_Directions#PieceByPiece "Pieces versus Directions") [move generation](Move_Generation "Move Generation"), the origin squares are subject of an outer loop over all pieces, while the target squares are subject of an inner loop. [Direction-wise](Pieces_versus_Directions#DirectionWise "Pieces versus Directions") move generation traverses target squares per direction and generally requires more effort to determine the from-squares.
