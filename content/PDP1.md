[ PDP-1, [CRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube), [TTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter) and processor rack <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>
**PDP-1**, (Programmed Data Processor-1)  

the first computer in [DEC's](Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation") [Programmed Data Processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_Data_Processor) series, first launched in 1960, forerunner of the [PDP-8](PDP-8 "PDP-8") and [PDP-11](PDP-11 "PDP-11") minicomputers, and the World's first commercial [interactive computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_computing) used for [process control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_control), [scientific research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_research), and [graphics programming](Graphics_Programming "Graphics Programming"), as well as to pioneer [timesharing systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing).


Based on the [TX-0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TX-0) and [TX-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TX-2) computers he had designed at [MIT's](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") [Lincoln Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Laboratory), [Ben Gurley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Gurley) constructed the PDP-11 in under three–and–a–half months <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. The PDP-1 had 4K 18-bit words as standard main [memory](Memory "Memory"), upgradable to 64K words, and an internal instruction execution rate of 100,000 to 200,000 per second <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>. [Signed numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_number_representations) were represented in [ones' complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones%27_complement).

The processor consists of discrete [germanium transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor#Germanium_transistors) logic in form of [System Building Block modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation#Digital_modules), inserting 25 of them into a 5-1/4 inch section of a custom [19-inch rack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack).

## Assembly


In the early 60s, [Edward Fredkin](Edward_Fredkin "Edward Fredkin"), while affiliated with [BBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt,_Beranek_and_Newman), wrote the first PDP-1 [assembler](Assembly "Assembly") called **FRAP** (Fredkin’s Assembly Program) <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>.

## PDP-1 Chess


As told by [Alan Kotok](Alan_Kotok "Alan Kotok") at the PDP-1 Celebration Event Lecture, May 15, 2006 <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a>, **PDP-1 Chess**, a apparently strong new chess program developed at [BBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolt,_Beranek_and_Newman) or elsewhere, was a [hoax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax). Kotok, at that time in the early 60s student at [MIT](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") and PDP-1 programmer, was member of the [Tech Model Railroad Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club) as well as member of the chess group around [John McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy"), and already co-author of [Kotok-McCarthy](Kotok-McCarthy-Program "Kotok-McCarthy-Program") for the [IBM 7090](IBM_7090 "IBM 7090"). He and some of his colleagues had established a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network), a [TTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter) connection between the PDP-1 and the TX 0 in an adjoining room, where some of the better MIT chess players "simulated" PDP-1 Chess with a chess board at the TTY console, playing a game versus some testers with McCarthy involved. The "cheat" was finally noticed, when later during the game both board positions somehow became out of sync.



## Spacewar!


In 1961/62, [Steve Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Russell) developed [Spacewar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!), one of the first interactive [video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_video_game#1961:_Spacewar.21), after Alan Kotok obtained some [sine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine) and cosine routines from DEC <a id="cite-note-8" href="#cite-ref-8">[8]</a>.
