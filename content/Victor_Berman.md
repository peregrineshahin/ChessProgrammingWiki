**Victor Berman**,  

an American electrical engineer, computer scientist, manager, pioneer in the development of [hardware description languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language), configurable [DSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor) and [EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation) solutions, and early computer chess programmer. While affiliated with [Cadence Design Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_Design_Systems), Victor Berman pioneered in the development of [Hardware description languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language) such as [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL), [Verilog-XL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog), and as Board member of [The SPIRIT Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPIRIT_Consortium), in the development of the [System Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog) standard. He was further board member of the [IEEE](IEEE "IEEE") [Standards Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Standards_Association). Actually, Berman is managing partner of [Berman Traders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuberger_Berman), and before, he worked with *Wormser Energy Solutions, Inc.* <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> as [COO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer), and served at *Improv Systems Inc.* <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> as president and [CEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer) <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>.

Victor Berman studied language design and electrical engineering in the interdisciplinary computer science graduate program at [Carnegie Mellon University](Carnegie_Mellon_University "Carnegie Mellon University"), where he was also involved in the development of the chess program [CHAOS](CHAOS "CHAOS") <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>, along with [Mike Alexander](Mike_Alexander "Mike Alexander"), [Fred Swartz](Fred_Swartz "Fred Swartz"), [Ira Ruben](Ira_Ruben "Ira Ruben"), [William Toikka](William_Toikka "William Toikka"), [Joe Winograd](Joe_Winograd "Joe Winograd") and later [Mark Hersey](Mark_Hersey "Mark Hersey") and [Jack O’Keefe](Jack_O%E2%80%99Keefe "Jack O’Keefe") <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>. CHAOS started at [RCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA) Systems Programming division in [Cinnaminson, NJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnaminson_Township,_New_Jersey) with [Fred Swartz](Fred_Swartz "Fred Swartz") and Victor Berman as first authors, Berman working on the very sophisticated [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation"). [Mike Alexander](Mike_Alexander "Mike Alexander") and others joined the team later and CHAOS has been affiliated with the Computing Center of the [University of Michigan](University_of_Michigan "University of Michigan"). CHAOS was one of the strongest programs of its time, using an unique, knowledge based and selective [best-first](Best-First "Best-First"), iterative widening approach <a id="cite-note-7" href="#cite-ref-7">[7]</a>, keeping the [search tree](Search_Tree "Search Tree") in memory.
