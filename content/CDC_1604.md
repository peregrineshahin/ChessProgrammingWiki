The **CDC 1604** was a [48-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/48-bit_computing) [mainframe computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer), designed and manufactured by [Seymour Cray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Cray) and his team at the [Control Data Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_Data_Corporation) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, introduced in October 1959 <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a> to become one of the first commercially successful [transistorized computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_computer).

## Architecture

The processor running at 208 kHz contained a 48-bit accumulator (A), a 48-bit mask register (Q), a 15-bit program counter (P), and six 15-bit index registers.
Internal integer representation used [ones' complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones%27_complement) arithmetic. The most-significant three bits of the accu were [converted to analog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter) output, connected to a [valve audio amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_audio_amplifier) in the console to generate sound.
The 24-bit instruction format had a six bit opcode field, three bits either for branch condition or index, and fifteen bits for immediate address operand or shift count. [Memory](Memory "Memory") consisted of 32K 48-bit words of [magnetic core memory](Memory#Core "Memory") with a cycle time of 6.4 microseconds <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>.
