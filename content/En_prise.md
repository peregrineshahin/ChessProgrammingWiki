**En prise** (from French "can be taken") <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a> describes a [piece](Pieces "Pieces") or [pawn](Pawn "Pawn") exposed to a [material](Material "Material") winning [capture](Captures "Captures") by the opponent. This is either a [hanging piece](Hanging_Piece "Hanging Piece"), a not defended pawn <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, a piece [attacked](Attacks "Attacks") by a lower valuable attacker, or a piece or pawn defended insufficiently. Any least valuable attacker (LVA) would gain a positive score from a [static exchange evaluator](Static_Exchange_Evaluation "Static Exchange Evaluation") on the [target square](Target_Square "Target Square"), which also applies to a knight defended by a pawn and attacked by bishop and rook, where the majority of attackers and a least valuable attacker of similar value makes the knight en prise.

With [pins](Pin "Pin"), [overloading](Overloading "Overloading"), and other tactical motives in mind, whether keeping or putting a piece en prise is a [blunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blunder_%28chess%29) or a [sacrifice](Sacrifice "Sacrifice") is a matter of [search](Search "Search"), the latter may require some [depth](Depth "Depth") left to differentiate.
