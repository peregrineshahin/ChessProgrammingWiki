Quote from *Biography AS Kronrod* by Alexander Yershov <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>



 In 1958, [Kronrod](Alexander_Kronrod "Alexander Kronrod"), [Adelson-Velsky](Georgy_Adelson-Velsky "Georgy Adelson-Velsky"), and [Landis](Mathematician#Landis "Mathematician") selected "[Snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapjack)" ("подкидного дурака") as the intellectual foundations for the development of the game heuristic programming <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. The program itself was a fiasco - but the basic principles (board games, [search techniques](Search "Search") and [limited depth](Depth "Depth")) were formulated. Further research laboratories in the field of game theory culminated in the first ever chess duel between the [program](ITEP_Chess_Program "ITEP Chess Program") of the [Institute](Institute_of_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Physics "Institute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics") of Soviet and American [best program](Kotok-McCarthy-Program "Kotok-McCarthy-Program") developed at [Stanford University](Stanford_University "Stanford University") under the direction of [J. McCarthy](John_McCarthy "John McCarthy"). By [telegraph match](Stanford-ITEP_Match "Stanford-ITEP Match") was played in four games ended 3-1 in favor of our institute. At the time, chess became a [guinea pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig_%28disambiguation%29) for all programmers interested in [artificial intelligence](Artificial_Intelligence "Artificial Intelligence").1. <a id="cite-ref-1" href="#cite-note-1">↑</a> [Биография А.С.
