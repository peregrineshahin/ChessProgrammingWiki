**8086**,

a [16-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit) [microprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor) designed by [Intel](Intel "Intel") since 1976, released in 1978. Its principal architect was [Stephen P. Morse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_P._Morse). Marketed as [source compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_compatibility), the 8086 was designed so that [assembly language](Assembly "Assembly") for the 8-bit [8080](8080 "8080") could be automatically converted into equivalent (sub-optimal) 8086 source code. The [Intel 8088](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8088) variant had an 8-bit external [data bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_bus) and was used in the original [IBM PC](IBM_PC "IBM PC"). 8086 was the forerunner of Intel's [x86](X86 "X86") 32-bit architecture, starting with the [80386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80386) in 1985.

Despite the huge distribution of 8086/8088 based PCs, the 8086 was rarely found in [Dedicated Chess Computers](Dedicated_Chess_Computers "Dedicated Chess Computers").

## Registers

The eight [8080](8080 "8080") registers A, B, C, D, E, H, L, SP, with BC, DE and HL as possible 16 bit registers, were extended to eight (more or less general) 16-bit registers including the [stack pointer](Stack "Stack"). Four general purpose (GP) registers may treated as 16-bit [Word](Word "Word") as well as high and low [Byte](Byte "Byte"):

## Segmentation

The 8086 was able to address one MByte of physical [memory](Memory "Memory") and its external [address bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_bus) was 20 bit wide (the first 16 [multiplexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexed) with the data bus). The [physical address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_address) translation was done by shifting a segment register 4 bits left and adding an 16 bit offset.

```C++effective or physical address := 16 * segment + offset

```

As a result, each external address could be referred to by 212 different segment:offset pairs. Considered complicated and cumbersome by many (chess) programmers, this scheme had the advantage in porting programs less than 64 kilobytes from 8-bit 8080 avoiding the need for [relocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relocation_%28computer_science%29).

## Pointer

Compilers for the 8086 supported two or even three types of pointers, **near**, **far** and **huge**. Near pointers were 16-bit offsets implicitly associated with the program's code and/or data/stack segment and could only used within parts of a program small enough to fit in one 64 kilobyte segment. Far pointers were 32-bit segment:offset pairs. Huge pointers, which were like far pointers except that pointer arithmetic on a huge pointer treated it as a linear 20-bit pointer, while pointer arithmetic on a far pointer wrapped around within its 16-bit offset without touching the segment part of the address.

## Memory models

To avoid the need to specify near and far on pointers, data structures, and functions, compilers supported "memory models" which specified default pointer sizes. The **tiny** (max 64K), **small** (max 128K), **compact** (data > 64K), **medium** (code > 64K), **large** (code,data > 64K), and **huge** (individual arrays > 64K) models covered practical combinations of near, far, and huge pointers for code and data. The tiny model with code and data in a single segment, just as in most 8-bit based processors, could be used to build [.com-files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COM_file). Precompiled libraries often came in several versions compiled for different memory models <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> .
