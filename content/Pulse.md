**Pulse**,  

a free [open source chess engine](Category:Open_Source "Category:Open Source") by [Phokham Nonava](Phokham_Nonava "Phokham Nonava"), written in [Java](Java "Java") **and** [C++](Cpp "Cpp"), released under the [MIT license](Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology#License "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"). 
The Java Edition supports [UCI](UCI "UCI") through the [Java Chess Protocol Interface](index.php?title=Java_Chess_Protocol_Interface&action=edit&redlink=1 "Java Chess Protocol Interface (page does not exist)") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a> 
and runs on all available Java 11 platforms including [Windows](Windows "Windows"), [OS X](Mac_OS "Mac OS") and [Linux](Linux "Linux"). 
Pulse is a simple chess engine with didactic intentions in mind. The source code should be easy to read, so that new developers can learn, how to build a chess engine.

Woodcut illustration from an edition of 1554 (33rd year of the [Jiajing reign period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiajing_Emperor) of the [Ming dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty)). [The images](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pulse_diagnosis_techniques;_Fuzhen_and_yangzhen_Wellcome_L0038044.jpg) show the distinct techniques to be used for taking another person's pulse and taking one's own pulse. In taking someone else's pulse, the hand used to take the pulse is held palm downward so that the index finger, middle finger and ring finger are positioned on the cun (Inch), guan (Pass) and chi (Foot) pulse sectors of the wrist respectively. This is called fuzhen ('downturned diagnosis'). In taking one's own pulse, the same relationship between the fingers and the three pulse sectors is preserved by holding the hand palm upwards. This is called yangzhen ('upturned diagnosis'). [Wellcome Images](https://wellcomecollection.org), [Wikimedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Commons)
