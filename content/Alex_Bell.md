**Alex G. Bell**,

a British computer scientist and early computer chess and [game](Games "Games") programmer from [Manchester University](University_of_Manchester "University of Manchester") and [Atlas Computer Laboratory](Atlas_Computer_Laboratory "Atlas Computer Laboratory"). Bell started chess and games programming in the early 60s, initially working for [Nils Barricelli](Nils_Barricelli "Nils Barricelli") and his chess program for [symbio-organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm) research. He also wrote his own programs for [Kalah](Kalah "Kalah") and Chess, which was called [Atlas](Atlas "Atlas"). Alex Bell published various papers about those topics, his 1972 book *Games Playing with Computers* is a real quarry and covers a broad range of basic AI-algorithms and games. Fortunately, thanks to the [Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_Appleton_Laboratory) archive, it is available online <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>, as well as other valuable resources quoted here in the chess programming wiki. In the 70s Atlas evolved to [Master](Master "Master") in collaboration with [Peter Kent](Peter_Kent "Peter Kent"), [John Birmingham](John_Birmingham "John Birmingham") and chess expert [John Waldron](John_Waldron "John Waldron"). Alex Bell was further involved to establish [computer chess conferences](Conferences "Conferences") .

## Atlas

In 1962, when Bell was at [Manchester University](University_of_Manchester "University of Manchester"), [Nils Barricelli](Nils_Barricelli "Nils Barricelli") arrived there with the intention to write a chess program for the [Atlas Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Computer_%28Manchester%29), which would be used to study certain theories of [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution). Alex Bell was hired by [Atlas Computer Laboratory](Atlas_Computer_Laboratory "Atlas Computer Laboratory") at [Chilton site, Oxfordshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilton,_Oxfordshire) for the purpose to write a list legal moves generator for Barricelli's project. Bell later reproduced the Barricelli chess program in [Algol](Algol "Algol") with quite a good user interface.

## Master

When Alex Bell left Atlas Laboratory in 1969, his fellow [Peter Kent](Peter_Kent "Peter Kent") took over his code. In 1973 after Alex' return, he joined forces with Peter and [John Birmingham](John_Birmingham "John Birmingham") from [Harwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Research_Establishment) to work on the chess playing program [Master](Master "Master") (**M**inimax **a**lgorithm Te**ster**), which competed at the [First World Computer Chess Championship 1974](WCCC_1974 "WCCC 1974") in Stockholm <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>. Alex left Chilton a second time and moved to [CSIRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO) in [Canberra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra) in 1975, and [Master](Master "Master") played the following [World Computer Chess Championships](World_Computer_Chess_Championship "World Computer Chess Championship"), [WCCC 1977](WCCC_1977 "WCCC 1977") and [WCCC 1980](WCCC_1980 "WCCC 1980") with Peter Kent and John Birmingham as sole authors <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>.

## Computer Chess Conferences

Alex Bell was initiator and co-organizer of the two first computer chess conferences in 1973 and 1975, while the latter became the [Advances in Computer Chess 1](Advances_in_Computer_Chess_1 "Advances in Computer Chess 1") conference <a id="cite-note-6" href="#cite-ref-6">[6]</a>.
