**Trial and Error** is a general [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving) method in contrast of an approach using [insight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight) and [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory). In science, formulation and testing of [hypotheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis) is based on trial and error, in computer science also called *generate and test*, and in [elementary algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_algebra), when solving certain equations, called *guess and check*. [Learning](Learning "Learning") and optimization methods such as [genetic algorithms](Genetic_Programming#GeneticAlgorithm "Genetic Programming"), [simulated annealing](Simulated_Annealing "Simulated Annealing") and [reinforcement learning](Reinforcement_Learning "Reinforcement Learning") also apply trial and error methods. In general, trial and error makes no attempt to discover why a solution works, but that it is a solution. A further application related to computer chess is to [find factors](Looking_for_Magics "Looking for Magics") for the application of [Magic Bitboards](Magic_Bitboards "Magic Bitboards") with spare populated, but otherwise [randomly chosen numbers](Pseudorandom_Number_Generator "Pseudorandom Number Generator").
