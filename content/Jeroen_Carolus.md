**Jeroen W.T. Carolus**,  

a Dutch computer scientist and software developer. In 2006, he defended his Master's thesis at [University of Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Amsterdam) on a variation of [Futility Pruning](Futility_Pruning "Futility Pruning") dubbed [Sibling Prediction Pruning](Sibling_Prediction_Pruning "Sibling Prediction Pruning") under the title *Alpha-Beta with Sibling Prediction Pruning in Chess* under supervision of [Paul Klint](Mathematician#PKlint "Mathematician") <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. 



## Chess Software


For his masters thesis, a chess engine was created in [Java](Java "Java") with the 64 bits [bitboard](Bitboards "Bitboards") approach. The idea was to create the source for educational purposes, since a chess application contains a lot of software building challenges such as a nice [GUI](GUI "GUI") and optimized computation. This project, unfortunately and practically, could not be fitted into a master's thesis. It has been ported to [C++](Cpp "Cpp") and communicates to the [GUI](GUI "GUI") via the [JNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface). The forward pruning search optimization was used for research. Several of his [Android](Android "Android") applications are using this chess engine, now dubbed [Android-Chess](index.php?title=Android-Chess&action=edit&redlink=1 "Android-Chess (page does not exist)").
