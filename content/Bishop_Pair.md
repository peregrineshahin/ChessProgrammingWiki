Since in the [initial position](Initial_Position "Initial Position") [bishops](Bishop "Bishop") stand on the [squares](Squares "Squares") of different [color](Color "Color"), throughout the game they control a disjoint sets of squares. This means that their power will never be wasted for carrying out the same tasks. On the other hand, lack of one bishop may introduce a [color weakness](Color_Weakness "Color Weakness"). Taking all those considerations into account, one might conclude that possessing both bishops is a desirable thing. The question is, however, how much they are worth.

[Larry Kaufman](Larry_Kaufman "Larry Kaufman") proposed the value of half a pawn <a id="cite-note-1" href="#cite-ref-1">[1]</a>. It must be stressed, however, that this number is a part of a broader system, in which knights are stronger with many pawns on the board.
