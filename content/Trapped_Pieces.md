**[Home](Home "Home") \* [Evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") \* Trapped Pieces**


**Trapped pieces** are the extreme examples of poor [mobility](Mobility "Mobility"). They are awkwardly placed and often endangered. A typical example of a trapped [piece](Pieces "Pieces") is a white [Bishop](Bishop "Bishop") on h7 blocked by the black [pawns](Pawn "Pawn") on f7 and g6. Most of the time it gets eventually captured, but it takes so much time that can be easily pushed over the horizon. Most of the time the best thing such a bishop can do is to [sacrifice](Sacrifice "Sacrifice") itself for a (second) pawn, so its value should be decreased by about 150.
