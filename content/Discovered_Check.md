A **Discovered Check** is a [X-ray](X-ray "X-ray") related chess [tactic](Tactics "Tactics"), revealed when one piece moves out of the way of a [sliding piece](Sliding_Pieces "Sliding Pieces") [ray](Rays "Rays"), discovering an [attack](Check "Check") to the opponent [king](King "King"). Discovered checks can be extremely powerful, as the piece moved can make a threat independently of the check giving piece it reveals, including the [double check](Double_Check "Double Check"). Pieces potentially able to discover a check can be determined almost with the same method along with a union set of [pinned pieces](Pin "Pin"), which might be separated by piece color later.
