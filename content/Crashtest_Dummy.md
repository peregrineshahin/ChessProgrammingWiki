**Crashtest Dummy** (Crash Test Dummy, CTD),

a [Chess Engine Communication Protocol](Chess_Engine_Communication_Protocol "Chess Engine Communication Protocol") and [UCI](UCI "UCI") compliant experimental chess engine by [Richard Pijl](Richard_Pijl "Richard Pijl"), intended as a test bed for his primary engine [The Baron](The_Baron "The Baron"). Richard started with CTD in about 2004, when he was getting nowhere with improving the Baron. When CTD was able to play a game, he decided to give the Baron one more look, instantly removed the bug that was blocking improvement and kept CTD in a drawer. At another point Richard was about to retire the Baron and to work only on CTD, as its successor <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>.
