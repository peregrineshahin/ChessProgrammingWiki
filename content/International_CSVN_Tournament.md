From 2001 until 2013 the [Dutch Computer Chess Federation (CSVN)](CSVN "CSVN") organized the **International CSVN Tournaments**. Also known as the **ICT**, the CSVN spring tournament. Along with the [Dutch Open Computer Chess Championship](Dutch_Open_Computer_Chess_Championship "Dutch Open Computer Chess Championship") in fall, both were superseded by the [CSVN Programmers Tournament](CSVN_Programmers_Tournament "CSVN Programmers Tournament").
