**Komodo**,  

a chess engine by primary author [Don Dailey](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") (died at the age of 57 on November 22, 2013) and since October 2013, by [Mark Lefler](Mark_Lefler "Mark Lefler"), supported by chess advisor and evaluation expert and Don's long time collaborator [Larry Kaufman](Larry_Kaufman "Larry Kaufman"). Since 2015, [opening book expert](Category:Opening_Book_Author "Category:Opening Book Author") [Erdogan Günes](Erdogan_G%C3%BCnes "Erdogan Günes") is responsible for Komodo's [book moves](Opening_Book "Opening Book").
At the [WCCC 2016](WCCC_2016 "WCCC 2016") [Komodo 10.x](#10) first time won the [Shannon Trophy](Shannon_Trophy "Shannon Trophy"), defended by subsequent versions at the [WCCC 2017](WCCC_2017 "WCCC 2017"), [WCCC 2018](WCCC_2018 "WCCC 2018") and [WCCC 2019](WCCC_2019 "WCCC 2019") so far. 
In November 2020, the [Dragon by Komodo Chess](Dragon_by_Komodo_Chess "Dragon by Komodo Chess") was released, featuring [NNUE](NNUE "NNUE") technology.


Komodo appeared in January 2010 derived from Don's former engine [Doch](Doch "Doch"). It uses [bitboards](Bitboards "Bitboards") as internal board representation, and has a sophisticated [search](Search "Search") and a knowledge based, balanced [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation"). 
Komodo is a standalone chess engine supporting the [UCI](UCI "UCI") protocol and is available for multiple platforms and [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), and is therefore compatible with free and commercial UCI compliant chess [graphical user interfaces](GUI "GUI") and [database](Databases "Databases") front ends.


As of December 2011, Komodo became commercial with version **4** [[2]](#cite_note-2), earlier versions running under [Windows](Windows "Windows"), [Linux](Linux "Linux"), [Mac OS](Mac_OS "Mac OS") and [Android](Android "Android") are available from the Komodo download site, free for non-commercial use [[3]](#cite_note-3) [[4]](#cite_note-4). Next release date was May 2013, with [CCT15](CCT15 "CCT15") winner Komodo **CCT** [[5]](#cite_note-5).

### Komodo 5


Komodo **5.1 MP**, released in June 2013, was a major rewrite in [C++11](Cpp#11 "Cpp"), able to perform a [parallel search](Parallel_Search "Parallel Search") to run on multiple processors [[6]](#cite_note-6) . 




### Komodo 6


In October 2013, Don Dailey announced the release of Komodo **6** and also bad news concerning the future status of Komodo due to his fatal illness of a acute form of [Leukemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia) [[7]](#cite_note-7) . He introduced [Mark Lefler](Mark_Lefler "Mark Lefler") as new member of the Komodo team [[8]](#cite_note-8) [[9]](#cite_note-9) . Don Dailey died November 22, 2013 at age 57, just about the same time that Komodo pulled ahead of [Stockfish](Stockfish "Stockfish") by winning game 2 in the [TCEC Season 5 final](TCEC_Season_5#Superfinal "TCEC Season 5") [[10]](#cite_note-10) [[11]](#cite_note-11) . 




### Komodo TCEC and 7


As winner of the TCEC 5 final, Komodo **TCEC** was released on December 04, 2013 [[12]](#cite_note-12), the further improved Komodo **7** on May 21, 2014, now supporting [Syzygy Bases](Syzygy_Bases "Syzygy Bases") [[13]](#cite_note-13), probing code interface implementation by [Jeremy Bernstein](Jeremy_Bernstein "Jeremy Bernstein") [[14]](#cite_note-14).




### Komodo 8


Komodo **8**, released on September 05, 2014, was a substantial improvement over Komodo 7a, which was already rated among the top three chess engines on almost all rating lists [[15]](#cite_note-15). Komodo 8 supports [Syzygy Bases](Syzygy_Bases "Syzygy Bases") and is available for [Windows](Windows "Windows"), [Linux](Linux "Linux"), [Mac OS](Mac_OS "Mac OS") and [Android](Android "Android"), the latter immediately available for import in [Chess for Android](Chess_for_Android "Chess for Android") and in [Chess for Glass](Chess_for_Glass "Chess for Glass") [[16]](#cite_note-16). Since mid September 2014, Komodo 8 for Windows is available as [ChessBase](ChessBase "ChessBase") engine, bundled with the [Deep Fritz interface](Fritz#DeepFritz14 "Fritz"), Syzygy bases not included [[17]](#cite_note-17).




### Komodo 9


Komodo **9**, released on April 28, 2015, continued the progress with approximately +50 Elo over Komodo 8 due to improved [search](Search "Search"), [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation"), and [time management](Time_Management "Time Management"), as well as more efficient use of multiprocessing [[18]](#cite_note-18). Most noticeable is the increase in [search depth](Depth "Depth") reached in a given amount of time, which is due to better [extension](Extensions "Extensions"), [reduction](Reductions "Reductions"), and [pruning](Pruning "Pruning") rules [[19]](#cite_note-19). Further, Komodo 9 now features [Chess960](Chess960 "Chess960") and a [persistant hash](Persistent_Hash_Table "Persistent Hash Table") to save and restore analysis.




### Komodo 10


On May 23, 2016, Komodo **10** came with revised and improved [king safety](King_Safety "King Safety"), [pawn storm](King_Safety#PawnStorm "King Safety") and [passed pawn](Passed_Pawn "Passed Pawn") [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation"), as well with revised [LMR](Late_Move_Reductions "Late Move Reductions"), [NMP](Null_Move_Pruning "Null Move Pruning"), [IID](Internal_Iterative_Deepening "Internal Iterative Deepening") and [history heuristic](History_Heuristic "History Heuristic") concerning [search](Search "Search"), and is about 60 Elo stronger than Komodo 9 [[20]](#cite_note-20). In [July 2016](#WCCC2016), **Komodo 10.x** won the [Shannon Trophy](Shannon_Trophy "Shannon Trophy"). 




### Komodo 11


On May 23, 2017, Komodo **11.01** was released, which corrected some minor issues of Komodo 11, which was already released by [ChessBase](ChessBase "ChessBase") a few days before. It is estimated about 55 Elo stronger than Komodo 10 at intermediate time controls, gains related to [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") [[21]](#cite_note-21), revised [quiescence search](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search"), [singular extensions](Singular_Extensions "Singular Extensions"), [LMR](Late_Move_Reductions "Late Move Reductions") , and [parallel search](Parallel_Search "Parallel Search") [[22]](#cite_note-22) . Komodo **11.2**, released on July 17, 2017, was the version which won the [WCCC 2017](WCCC_2017 "WCCC 2017") [[23]](#cite_note-23). Komodo **11.3** was released on March 04, 2018 with subsequent improvements [[24]](#cite_note-24). It also comes with a [BMI2](BMI2 "BMI2") compile for compatible [x86-64](X86-64 "X86-64") processors - so far not recommend for [AMD](AMD "AMD") [Ryzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen) due to its slow [PEXT](BMI2#PEXT "BMI2") implementation [[25]](#cite_note-25). 




### Komodo 12


Komodo **12** was released in May 2018. Beside the classical, slightly improved engine, Komodo 12 features an optional [Monte-Carlo Tree Search](Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search "Monte-Carlo Tree Search") (MCTS), the release likely influenced by the [AlphaZero](AlphaZero "AlphaZero") hype. 
However, as confirmed by [Mark Lefler](Mark_Lefler "Mark Lefler") [[26]](#cite_note-26)
implementing MCTS was already an old idea of the Komodo team - also due to [Don Dailey's](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") computer [Go](Go "Go") experience building an [UCT](UCT "UCT") player.




### Komodo MCTS


In Komodo's [MCTS](Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search "Monte-Carlo Tree Search") mode the [search tree](Search_Tree "Search Tree") is expanded in [best-first](Best-First "Best-First") manner based on [winning probabilities](Pawn_Advantage,_Win_Percentage,_and_Elo "Pawn Advantage, Win Percentage, and Elo") 
determined neither by random playouts nor by a [neural network](Neural_Networks "Neural Networks"), but a tiny [alpha-beta search](Alpha-Beta "Alpha-Beta") plus [quiescence](Quiescence_Search "Quiescence Search") and [static evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation"), also similar to [UCT](UCT "UCT"), dealing with the crucial trade-off between [exploration and exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search#Exploration_and_exploitation). While [playing strength](Playing_Strength "Playing Strength") is lower with MCTS, positional play and judgement may well be better in many positions [[27]](#cite_note-27), not to mention a more risky and entertaining playing style.




### Komodo 13


In May 2019, Komodo **13** was released with substantial improvements in [MCTS](Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search "Monte-Carlo Tree Search") mode. 
Quote by [Larry Kaufman](Larry_Kaufman "Larry Kaufman") [[28]](#cite_note-28):




```
The changes from Komodo 12 to 13 in MCTS mode (which is where most of the changes were made) are so vast and pervasive that it is hopeless to even try to enumerate them. The elo gains are in the 300 to 400 range on any number of threads, so it's really a very different engine. Virtually every aspect was improved, some of the changes being rather radical. Most cannot be explained without describing in detail how Komodo MCTS works, which is pretty unique. As for regular Komodo, there were quite a few changes, but only a few that show up as measurable elo gains on one to four threads. To be honest, if you never use [MultiPV](Principal_Variation#MultiPV "Principal Variation") or MCTS mode, don't have more than a few cores, and already own Komodo 12, I wouldn't recommend spending the money for Komodo 13 unless the cost is insignificant to you. But I think that most people do use MultiPV, and if so Komodo 13 MCTS is clearly better than Komodo 12 in either mode.

```





### Komodo 14


Komodo **14**, released in May 2020 with following improvements announced by [Larry Kaufman](Larry_Kaufman "Larry Kaufman") [[29]](#cite_note-29): 




```
The improvements cover a wide range of issues, including [extensions](Extensions "Extensions"), [null move](Null_Move_Pruning "Null Move Pruning"), [King Safety](King_Safety "King Safety"), [time management](Time_Management "Time Management"), and many more. There is one new feature added since Komodo 13.3, "[Armageddon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess#Armageddon)" mode, which tells Komodo that White (or Black) must win, draws are scored as losses for that color. When draws are counted as losses for White, knowing this improves Komodo's performance as White by about 30 elo according to our tests. In Armageddon mode, the specified color (usually White) not only avoids clear draws, but adjusts [Contempt](Contempt_Factor "Contempt Factor") by an amount we determined was most helpful for Armageddon play. Testing on one thread in Armageddon mode suggests that on a modern laptop, if White gets one minute total plus 1% increment, and Black gets half a minute plus 1% increment plus draw odds, then chances are fairly close to balanced. Other features added since Komodo 13 include more levels, Personalities, and Auto-Skill. Standard mode remains the strongest when [Multi-PV](Principal_Variation#MultiPV "Principal Variation") is not in use, while [MCTS](Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search "Monte-Carlo Tree Search") mode is generally strongest when both are using Multi-PV.

```





### Dragon


Along with the release of Komodo **14.1** on November 02, 2020, [Larry Kaufman](Larry_Kaufman "Larry Kaufman") announced **Dragon**, featuring [NNUE](NNUE "NNUE") technology due to support of [Dietrich Kappe](Dietrich_Kappe "Dietrich Kappe") and [Dmitry Pervov](Dmitry_Pervov "Dmitry Pervov"), applied and trained with Komodo games and evaluation [[30]](#cite_note-30). Improvements for both standard and MCTS mode are expected in the 150 to 200 Elo range. [Dragon by Komodo Chess](Dragon_by_Komodo_Chess "Dragon by Komodo Chess") was released on November 10, 2020 [[31]](#cite_note-31).



## Tournament Play


Komodo played the [ICT 2010](ICT_2010 "ICT 2010") in [Leiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden) over the board, and further the [CCT12](CCT12 "CCT12") and [CCT14](CCT14 "CCT14"). 
It had its first tournament success in 2013, when it won the [CCT15](CCT15 "CCT15") with 6½/7, and further the [CCT16](CCT16 "CCT16") in 2014 with 5½/6. 



### TCEC


In 2013, Komodo started to play the [TCEC](TCEC "TCEC"), most often fighting with [Stockfish](Stockfish "Stockfish") for the title.
Komodo won the [TCEC Season 5](TCEC_Season_5 "TCEC Season 5"), [TCEC Season 7](TCEC_Season_7 "TCEC Season 7") in 2014, and the [TCEC Season 8](TCEC_Season_8 "TCEC Season 8") in Fall 2015.



### WCCC / WCSC / WCRCC


### 2015


At the [WCCC 2015](WCCC_2015 "WCCC 2015") in [Leiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden), Komodo 9.x won the Blitz tournament, and became runner-up behind and losing from the massively parallel and distributed [Jonny](Jonny "Jonny") which played on a cluster of 100x24 cores. 
After the revenge winning against Jonny at the equal hardware [WCSC 2015](WCSC_2015 "WCSC 2015") a few days later, Komodo was unlucky and made too many draws against apparently weaker opponents [[32]](#cite_note-32), to became third behind [Shredder](Shredder "Shredder") and [Ginkgo](Ginkgo "Ginkgo"). 
Two weeks later, Komodo won the [WCRCC 2015](WCRCC_2015 "WCRCC 2015") convincingly with 9/9!

### 2016


The [2016](Timeline#2016 "Timeline") [ICGA](ICGA "ICGA") [tournaments](Tournaments_and_Matches "Tournaments and Matches") in [Leiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiden) were a huge success for **Komodo 10.x**, which did not only won the [Shannon Trophy](Shannon_Trophy "Shannon Trophy") in the open hardware [World Computer Chess Championship](WCCC_2016 "WCCC 2016") after a nerve-racking six games play-off versus defending champion [Jonny](Jonny "Jonny") - Komodo with 48 [threads](Thread "Thread") on 60 core [Intel](Intel "Intel") i7 versus Jonny's cluster of 100x24 [AMD](AMD "AMD") cores, but also the equal hardware [World Chess Software Championship](WCSC_2016 "WCSC 2016") with 5/6 - 1½ points ahead of runner-up Jonny and [Shredder](Shredder "Shredder"). 
Two weeks later Komodo defended its [ACCA](ACCA "ACCA") title in rapid chess at the [WCRCC 2016](WCRCC_2016 "WCRCC 2016") with 14 wins and one draw versus runner-up [Andscacs](Andscacs "Andscacs"), that is 14½ out of 15.

### 2017


In [2017](Timeline#2017 "Timeline"), Komodo could defend it titles at the [WCRCC 2017](WCRCC_2017 "WCRCC 2017") online, and the soon later released [Komodo 11.2](#11) the [ICGA](ICGA "ICGA") [WCCC 2017](WCCC_2017 "WCCC 2017") over the board, again in a play-off versus [Jonny](Jonny "Jonny"). Komodo further became runner-up at the uniform hardware [WCSC 2017](WCSC_2017 "WCSC 2017") behind [Shredder](Shredder "Shredder").

### 2018


In [2018](Timeline#2018 "Timeline") [Komodo 12](#12) continued its success by winning the [ICGA](ICGA "ICGA") [WCCC 2018](WCCC_2018 "WCCC 2018"), [WCSC 2018](WCSC_2018 "WCSC 2018") and Blitz tournaments in [Stockholm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm), and later that year the [WCRCC 2018](WCRCC_2018 "WCRCC 2018") online.



### 2019


[Komodo 13.1](Komodo#13 "Komodo") [[36]](#cite_note-36) was able to defend both titles at the [ICGA](ICGA "ICGA") [WCCC 2019](WCCC_2019 "WCCC 2019") and [WCSC 2019](WCSC_2019 "WCSC 2019") in [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau), the WCCC on a 128 cores.



## Quotes


### Promotions


[Don Dailey](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") on [Minor Promotions](Promotions "Promotions") [[37]](#cite_note-37) :




```
Komodo never looks at rook or bishop under promotions and only looks at knight under promotions when it gives check. But even for the knight case there are positions where my rule won't find the right move. 

```

### Evaluation


### Centered Point Values


In 2012, [Don Dailey](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") gave following [point values](Point_Value "Point Value") in a kind of [millipawn scale](Millipawns "Millipawns"), [tapered](Tapered_Eval "Tapered Eval") between [opening](Opening "Opening") and [endgame](Endgame "Endgame") phase with [knight](Knight "Knight") and [bishop](Bishop "Bishop") values constant - positional scores from [mobility](Mobility "Mobility") and [piece square tables](Piece-Square_Tables "Piece-Square Tables") centered around zero [[38]](#cite_note-38) :





|  |  Pawn
 |  Knight
 |  Bishop
 |  Rook
 |  Queen

### Quality of Knowledge


[Don Dailey](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") in a reply to [Vincent Diepeveen](Vincent_Diepeveen "Vincent Diepeveen") [[39]](#cite_note-39) :




```
*Don, Your program is kind of a beancounter that relies heavily positional upon [piece square tables](Piece-Square_Tables "Piece-Square Tables")*. 

```


```
You could not be more incorrect. We have piece square tables in Komodo that are a very minor part of Komodo and get very small weights but Komodo puts a huge emphasis on getting the [evaluation](Evaluation "Evaluation") right with hundreds of evaluation terms that are carefully balanced to produce a find positional chess program. I personally believe that Komodo has the best evaluation function of any chess program in the world.
...
Total amount of [knowledge](Knowledge "Knowledge") is not what is important, it's the QUALITY of the knowledge that is. Komodo tries to have the most balanced evaluation function possible, and probably much more knowledge than most programs. I don't believe in quantity but Komodo evolved to have a lot of knowledge anyway - probably because every piece of knowledge in Komodo is needed. I tried removing knowledge in Komodo to get speed and we were not able to remove ANYTHING without noticing that it weakened Komodo, at least slightly. 

```

### Lazy Evaluation


[Don Dailey](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") on [Selectivity](Selectivity "Selectivity") and [Lazy Evaluation](Lazy_Evaluation "Lazy Evaluation") [[40]](#cite_note-40) :




```
Komodo pushes the selectivity pretty hard and we DO get a decent [nodes per second](Nodes_per_Second "Nodes per Second") increase with Lazy evaluation but the problem is that we get a big increase in [nodes](Node "Node"). It is this way because we assume we will not make scout if the guesstimate is too low. So we miss some of the [beta cutoffs](Beta-Cutoff "Beta-Cutoff"), you cannot have your cake and eat it too. Komodo's positional component can vary enormously so we do take a lot of damage positionally when we use lazy margins. 

```

### Node Counting


[Don Dailey](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") on counting [nodes](Node "Node") in Komodo 4 [[41]](#cite_note-41) :




```
 As Larry mentioned we are counting nodes differently. More specifically, both versions have always counted a node when a [move is made](Make_Move "Make Move"), but Komodo 3 would count nodes that were [forward pruned](Pruning "Pruning") (if the move was actually executed) and Komodo 4 does not. In Komodo 3 I figured that if any work was done (such as attack testing after making the move) it should count as a node. But in Komodo 4 we changed this because the move is technically being pruned (even if we had to check it out a bit first.) Of course if a move is searched or [reduced](Reductions "Reductions") it is counted in both versions.

```


```
It's mostly semantics, but we get more stable node counts and this works better for fixed node testing which we sometimes do.

```


```
I have several things in mind for getting serious speedups in future versions of Komodo which will bring the speed of Komodo back up to that of other programs, or at least not as far away. I believe Komodo is one of the slower programs in terms of raw search speed as we have put a really heavy focus on having a smart program and little on heavy optimization. The reasoning is the same for delaying the MP stuff too, we want to start with a really strong program before we play the optimization games. 

```

### Parallel Search


[Don Dailey](Don_Dailey "Don Dailey") about aspects of [parallel search](Parallel_Search "Parallel Search") in Komodo 5.1 MP [[42]](#cite_note-42)




```
How you approach a problem is strongly related to how you DEFINE a problem or task. The goal of MP is to make the program play as well as possible using more cores, to take advantage of the hardware as fully as possible and the only measure that really matters (at least to us) is [playing strength](Playing_Strength "Playing Strength"). We ALL wish that our program played as if it they were 4x faster when playing on 4 cores - but nobody gets that kind of efficiency.

```


```
Some have implied that we search wider because we don't get quite the same increase in depth and that this is a horrible thing. The intuition is that if that if it works you could do it on 1 thread too. However I do not think that follows. The problem is that 4 threads is just not 4x better than 1 thread no matter how good your MP implementation, so it always comes down to how to best utilize what you have. Anything goes in my opinion if it gets more out of extra cores in terms of ELO.

```


```
It is well known that programs do not scale well beyond a few processors. Going from 128 to 256 processors gives you very little. One of the things Larry and I want to do is to explore how to better exploit more and more cores and hopefully what we learn will translate to better performance on few cores. It is unlikely to be minor refinements to what we already do.

```


```
I'm not breaking new ground as this has been studied for decades and lots of ideas have been tried - I'm not pretending otherwise. But we will look at new original ideas we come up with and revisit old-fashioned ideas that have been tried in the past. A lot of the old ideas which have been rejected have later come back to life, so there is no idea that is off-limits.

```


```
As far as whether searching "wider" is a bad thing and isn't real parallelism, I disagree with that. If 4 cores were 4 times better than one I probably would agree but since it isn't, we have to determine where the effort is best spent. If you have 11 people in the room and 10 are doctors and the one who isn't has a heart attack, what is the best use of the doctors time? Not all 10 doctors can give CPR even though normally that would be very best use of their talent, but surely one of them will be calling for an ambulance while another will be doing CPR and the rest will be doing whatever they can to assist, even in little ways.

So if you are getting very little benefit out of additional processors you need to figure out if there is something else they can do to be more useful. Perhaps one thing is to deal with the lines that are severely reduced in the single core program? 

```

[Larry Kaufman](Larry_Kaufman "Larry Kaufman") in October 2018 [[43]](#cite_note-43):




```
Komodo (regular, not MCTS) has had a problem for many years now when running on many cores with large hash tables, as in TCEC. It takes several minutes to reach full speed. In three or four hour games this is not a big deal, but in a blitz event it is absolutely fatal, as you can see. I'm glad to report that Mark has finally solved the problem (as far as we can test, up to 36 cores), and this fix should be in time for the next TCEC and for our next release. Hopefully the next CCC event should show a huge difference.
