**Shu Yokoyama**,  

a Japanese computer scientist affiliated with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, [University of Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tokyo). His research interests include game playing algorithms and [search](Search "Search"), and in particular massively [parallel](Parallel_Search "Parallel Search") or distributed search algoritms. At the [Advances in Computer Games 14](Advances_in_Computer_Games_14 "Advances in Computer Games 14") conference in [Leiden](Leiden_University "Leiden University") 2015, he introduced the distributed search algorithm dubbed **P-GPP**, or pipelined game position parallelization.
