**Jay J.P. Scott**,  

an American mathematician with expertise in [machine learning](Learning "Learning") who works for *The Math Forum* at [Drexel University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexel_University) in [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia) <a id="cite-note-2" href="#cite-ref-2">[2]</a>. He maintains the *satirist.org* websites <a id="cite-note-3" href="#cite-ref-3">[3]</a>, including *Machine Learning in Games*, where he describes programs relying on heuristic [search](Search "Search") [algorithms](Algorithms "Algorithms"), [genetic algorithms](Genetic_Programming#GeneticAlgorithm "Genetic Programming"), [neural networks](Neural_Networks "Neural Networks"), and [temporal differences](Temporal_Difference_Learning "Temporal Difference Learning"). Jay Scott was an early [GNU Chess](GNU_Chess "GNU Chess") contributor, mentioned as co-author in the [ACM 1987](ACM_1987 "ACM 1987") booklet <a id="cite-note-4" href="#cite-ref-4">[4]</a>. He is further author of the experimental chess program [Kon](index.php?title=Kon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kon (page does not exist)") to study automated learning of [search](Search "Search") control, which used a [breadth-first](Best-First "Best-First") search and kept the entire [tree](Search_Tree "Search Tree") in [memory](Memory "Memory") <a id="cite-note-5" href="#cite-ref-5">[5]</a>.
