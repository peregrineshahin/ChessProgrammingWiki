The **Evaluation Function** is a part of the chess program that implements and performs the evaluation of a [position](Chess_Position "Chess Position"). The name can be quite misleading, as sometimes different functions, called from within the routine selecting them, are used to evaluate different types of positions. This is especially true as far as the [endgame](Endgame "Endgame") is concerned.
