**Weak Pawns**,  

pawns not defended and not defensible by the pawns of the same [color](Color "Color"), whose [stop square](Stop_Square "Stop Square") is also not covered by a friendly pawn. Some programs, most notably [Crafty](Crafty "Crafty"), do not differentiate between various classes of weak pawns, but most of the time their various kinds are evaluated differently.






* [Isolated Pawn](Isolated_Pawn "Isolated Pawn")
* [Backward Pawn](Backward_Pawn "Backward Pawn")
* **Overly advanced pawn** (technically neither isolated nor backward, but nevertheless not defensible by a pawn. Consider the following situation: white pawns on a3, b5 and c4, black pawns on a4, b6 and c7, where the black pawn on a4 falls into this category.)

Some also add [hanging pawns](Hanging_Pawns "Hanging Pawns"), but they are not as endangered and have a lot more attacking potential than any of the above.
