**Bibob**,

a [Windows](Windows "Windows") [bitboard](Bitboards "Bitboards") [MDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_document_interface) observer, editor and calculator by [Gerd Isenberg](Gerd_Isenberg "Gerd Isenberg") - so far in [Little-Endian Rank-File Mapping](Square_Mapping_Considerations#LittleEndianRankFileMapping "Square Mapping Considerations"), since version 2.2 all eight orthogonal mappings. This application is a little overdressed and was intended as play ground for some [MFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library) [GUI](GUI "GUI") features such as [toolbars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolbar) with various controls like a [Combo box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combo_box). For debugging under Windows, to inspect bitboards, one may [copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut,_copy,_and_paste) the content of 64-bit variables from a Debugger to the [clipboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipboard_%28computing%29) to paste it into a Bibob document window. Bibob accepts pasting [decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal) or [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) strings as well as [FEN](Forsyth-Edwards_Notation "Forsyth-Edwards Notation").

## [](File:Bibob.JPG) Features

Bibob is a Multiple Document Bitboard Viewer/Editor. It displays 64-bit Numbers in a Bitboard-Representation. Document-Windows act as Operands, a set of Unary as well as Binary Operations perform on Bitboards. A Second Operand Dropdown-Combobox features some common Constants, as well as Bitboards of other Document-
Windows - so that binary arithmetical and bitwise logical Operations may be performed between several Windows. Double click on a square toggles its state.

## Update 2.2

April 15, 2013

- Five new unary operators
- Persistent [Square Mapping Mode](Square_Mapping_Considerations "Square Mapping Considerations")
